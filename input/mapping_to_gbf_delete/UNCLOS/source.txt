The “BBNJ Agreement”, is the first comprehensive, cross-sectoral ocean treaty in decades. It was adopted on 19 June 2023, following nearly twenty years of negotiations. Its adoption marked a historic achievement in efforts to ensure the health and resilience of ocean ecosystems, and to level the playing field in the capacity to participate in and benefit from activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
The Agreement addresses a package of issues under the overall objective of ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction for the present and in the long term, through effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and further international cooperation and coordination. It sets out specific measures in respect of these issues, modalities to implement and monitor those measures, as well as institutional arrangements to support its implementation (Factsheet 1: Overview of the BBNJ Agreement).

The Agreement covers four main issues: 

Marine genetic resources, including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits (Factsheet 2);

Measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas (Factsheet 3);

Environmental impact assessments (Factsheet 4); and

Capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology (Factsheet 5). 

It also addresses so called “cross-cutting issues (Factsheet 6)”, which are topics that are transversal for the implementation of the Agreement and relevant to the four main issues.

The BBNJ Agreement is the third implementing agreement to the Convention, in addition to the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (Part XI Agreement), which addresses the exploitation for and exploration of mineral resources in the international seabed area (the “Area” as defined under the Convention), and the Agreement for the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks (United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement), which addresses the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.
