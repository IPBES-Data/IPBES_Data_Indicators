GEO6_1_1,1,10,"Although the SDGs link the environment much more closely to other development areas, they do not comprehensively represent the global environmental agenda (Wackernagel, Hanscom and Lin 2017). Some important environmental problems are not well reflected in the SDGs, such as mining and natural resource extraction, and the links between gender and the environment (e.g. indoor air pollution from cooking; Elder and Zusman 2016). The climate goal (SDG 13) does not have a target or INDICATOR directly related to the state of the climate, although it references the Paris Agreement, which does have such a target. Moreover, the environmental INDICATORs are not as well developed as those for other areas, and there is less data available to quantify their impacts and/ or progress towards achieving the related targets. Many targets have several dimensions, and often the dimension related to the environment is not included in the INDICATOR(s). The SDGs address the goals of many MEAs, although few of the many IAEGs are directly mentioned in the SDGs."
GEO6_1_2,1,10,"The target and INDICATOR-based approach, which was a key innovation of the MDGs, was also used by the SDGs, as well as by the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets developed under the CBD (Kanie and Biermann eds. 2017). Many felt that this approach made an important contribution to the MDGs’ relative success in mobilizing action and support, although it also has some disadvantages (Fukuda-Parr, Yamin and Greenstein 2014). If this approach is implemented broadly in line with the spirit and language of the SDGs, and not in a narrow instrumental manner, then implementation and accountability may be strengthened (Biermann, Kanie and Kim 2017). Another major innovation for the SDGs and the Paris Agreement is that each country agreed to translate the global goals and targets into national targets and INDICATORs; however, this will introduce the challenge/opportunity of accounting for progress."
GEO6_10_1,10,2,"Policies are crucial in determining and improving the state of our environment. A simple way to think about policy and policy instruments is that a policy is a statement of intent to change behaviour in a positive way, while an instrument is the means or a specific measure to translate that intent into action (Mees et al. 2014). Therefore, discussion of effectiveness of environmental policies means addressing both aspects. Goal setting (including targets, INDICATORs and time frames) is an important step towards legitimization of environmental policies. Execution of the policy instruments is through effective governance. Governance is “the process whereby societies or organizations make important decisions, determine whom they involve and how they render account” (United Nations Economic and Social Council 2006). The recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) give a new impetus to ‘governing through goals’ (Yoshida and Zusman 2015)."

GEO6_10_4,10,5,"Attributing causality to policies in often extensive and complex causal chains from policy, through its implementation, to behavioural changes and processes that are triggered, to impacts, indirect and induced impacts, is a particular challenge for policy evaluation (Forss, Marra and Schwartz eds. 2011). A conceptual approach was adopted in Part B of this report which aims to minimize the problem of attribution by combining a top-down and a bottom-up perspective (Sabatier 1986). The top-down perspective shown in Figure 10.1 starts with the policy and traces the causal chains that are expected from the implementation of the policy. The bottom-up perspective starts from the observed outcomes and uses policy- relevant INDICATORs to trace the causalities back to the policy interventions. This helps analysts to evaluate the effects of policy mixes. Both perspectives have their shortcomings – the top-down perspective tends to overemphasize the impacts of policies compared to other factors, the bottom-up perspective tends to overemphasize the impacts of contextual factors. effectiveness: top-down and bottom-up approach problem PART A responses) Bottom-up methodology What was the Which INDICATORs policy type that are most useful was selected for for monitoring the speciﬁc case the effectiveness study, and why? of policy PART B implementation?"
GEO6_10_5,10,5,Table 10.1 Policy relevant Policy typology INDICATORs POLICY TYPES INDICATORS base
GEO6_10_6,10,6,"The bottom-up evaluation, based on policy-relevant INDICATORs, complements the analysis and contributes in particular to the quantification and the identification of needs for further action (goal 2 of the evaluation). The methods for each approach are further elaborated in the following sections. Figure 10.1 graphically summarizes how to assess policy effectiveness through these top-down and bottom-up evaluations. 10.6 Top-down evaluation methodology The top-down evaluation of policy effectiveness in GEO- 6 starts with the selection of policies and governance arrangements and associated cases. For each thematic area, up to five promising policy types or governance arrangements are selected by considering the coverage of the variety of policy types and governance arrangements, geographical diversity and the availability of data."
GEO6_10_7,10,6,"Next, for each policy type or governance arrangement selected and evaluated, a case exemplifying the implementation of the policy is chosen and assessed in terms of policy effectiveness according to a common research protocol covering the achievement of stated objectives or improvement of relevant INDICATORs, the quality criteria of policy formulation and implementation (e.g. level of participation), ex ante or ex post assessments and the contextual requirements for the effectiveness."
GEO6_10_8,10,6,"The criteria for assessing the cases are derived from the literature on policy design and effectiveness. They are not prescriptive in terms of methods, data, policy instruments or causal chains, but on each aspect the relevant knowledge from the literature is presented. As all case studies are based on secondary data analysis, the research protocol necessarily leaves discretion to be adapted. For example, evaluation studies may be based on measuring effectiveness against the stated goal of policymakers, against an INDICATOR, against a control group or against a counterfactual scenario. The research protocol does not prescribe one or the other method for assessment, but provides transparency on the underlying methods, theories and data sources of the individual case study."
GEO6_10_9,10,7,"10.7 Bottom-up evaluation methodology An INDICATOR-based assessment of policy-sensitive/policy- relevant INDICATORs for each thematic area and cross-cutting issue complements the top-down evaluation and provides evidence on the quantification of policy effectiveness (Hezri and Dovers 2006; Bauler 2012; Moldan, Janoušková and Hák 2012). INDICATORs are constructed to measure the state of complex systems which may not be observed directly or comprehensively. They measure certain aspects and based on theoretical considerations and/or evidence, conclusions can be drawn regarding the state of the overall system. For the purpose of measuring policy effectiveness, it is necessary to be explicit on the theory regarding how policies and the selected INDICATOR interact."
GEO6_10_10,10,7,"INDICATORs that provide insights to the state of ecological or economic systems and their environmental performance are in many cases not directly influenced by policies. Instead, cultural, structural, political, geographical and other factors may intervene. Measuring the policy outputs (e.g. adoption of policy instruments) would not adequately capture the preferences of different countries for one or another instrument. For example, for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, one country may regulate emissions, another imposes taxes or emission trading schemes, a third implements information campaigns or subsidizes climate-friendly technologies. In each of these cases, the expected impact will be reducing emissions of GHGs. The INDICATOR is influenced, however, by the industrial structure, natural conditions, level of income and other factors that are not, or not directly, impacted by (environmental) policies."
GEO6_10_11,10,7,"Therefore, an INDICATOR-based assessment must have a transparent underlying theory on how policies would impact on the selected INDICATOR and what other factors may also have an influence. Figure 10.2 shows the underlying rationale for developing the theory on the relationship between policies and relevant INDICATORs."

GEO6_10_15,10,7,"For each INDICATOR, the following aspects are considered, based on peer-reviewed literature."
GEO6_10_16,10,7,1. Scope and measurement: the INDICATOR should provide insight into the state of the environment for the respective thematic area. The argument behind selecting each INDICATOR in a thematic area is made transparent.
GEO6_10_17,10,7,"2. Policy relevance: the causal relationship between policy measures and instruments and the INDICATOR is specified. Not all INDICATORs are policy sensitive but the following questions can be asked of the INDICATORs. Through which mechanisms would policies impact on the INDICATOR? What triggers (e.g. prices, command and control, persuasion) are used by policy instruments that would impact on the respective INDICATOR? Which actors change their behaviour as a result of these policies and how does this impact on the INDICATOR? How does this INDICATOR relate to the state of the environment (ideally at the country level)? What processes are triggered by changes in the INDICATOR and what are the impacts on the environment?"
GEO6_10_18,10,7,"3. Causal relations/causal chain(s): policy-sensitive INDICATORs are those for which a causal relationship to policies and their implementation can be demonstrated. While attribution of causality is challenging, INDICATORs can be selected for their responsiveness to policies as compared to other intervening factors such as sociodemographic factors, infrastructures, natural conditions and culture. Is there any evidence showing that INDICATORs can be associated with these causal output-outcome-impact chains? ‘Outputs’ and ‘outcomes’ are processes that are triggered by the policy and ‘impacts’ are the ultimate effects of a policy. Initial impact may again trigger other"
GEO6_10_19,10,8,"4. The analysis must consider other factors impacting on the INDICATOR. Is there any evidence showing that other factors not directly or immediately affected by policies (natural conditions, infrastructure, cultural, natural disasters) have demonstrated any impact on the INDICATOR? Are there uncertainties on causal relationships that affect the INDICATOR?"
GEO6_10_20,10,8,"5. Graphic representation and visualization: for each INDICATOR, data are presented on progress towards achieving the relevant international goals as well as the development of each INDICATOR at the country level (cross-longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis). Are there outstanding countries in terms of best performer or poor performer? Based on the previous steps a critical reflection should be undertaken: Is it possible to attribute this to policies and other factors? What are the uncertainties?"
GEO6_10_21,10,8,"6. Possible alternative INDICATORs: in case there are suggestions in the literature for other INDICATORs to measure policy effectiveness for the given thematic area, these are discussed. Is the suitability or relevance of the INDICATOR disputed? Are there other, alternative INDICATORs proposed to measure policy effectiveness? Why were these not considered in the analysis? The INDICATOR-based assessment of policy-sensitive INDICATORs described above does not aim for comprehensiveness: it is certainly not possible to cover all INDICATORs and all aspects for all the thematic areas and cross-cutting issues. This very partial coverage is acknowledged, and further efforts are needed in future GEOs to improve the coverage. 10.8 Content of Part B"
GEO6_10_22,10,8,"The remainder of Part B reflects these top-down and bottom-up approaches, with Chapter 11, based on literature, focusing on issues of policy design, spatial and temporal policy diffusion and evolution, and the effectiveness of international and multi-level governance. Chapters 12-17 cover the key policy approaches mentioned in Part A of the report, under the ‘responses’ section of the DPSIR framework. For each of these key policy approaches, a case study is used to exemplify the application of the policy approach in a specific context. Policy-sensitive INDICATORs for each thematic area and cross- cutting issue are also included in these six chapters. Chapter 18 draws conclusions and key messages for Part B and provides guidance for policymakers and the link to Part C of the report."
GEO6_11_1,11,6,"In the past, attempts to measure policy effectiveness assumed there was a one-to-one correlation between an environmental policy and its outcomes (Weber, Driessen and Runhaar 2013). In some cases, this may be warranted, such as a government command and control policy to remove lead from petrol or from paint (see the subsequent discussion of policy-sensitive INDICATORs). However, in most of the case studies in Chapters 12-17, attributing environmental outcomes to specific policies is shown to be challenging. Counterfactual scenarios (i.e. without policy) cannot be implemented experimentally, for practical and ethical reasons among others, as it is not justifiable to expose one group to a policy against a harmful pollutant and not others (Niles and Lubell 2012)."
GEO6_11_2,11,6,"As INDICated in Chapter 10, within the environmental domain a key lesson learned is to carefully craft a mix of policies that are well aligned with the overall policy objective (OECD, IEA, Nuclear Energy Agency [NEA] and International Transport Forum efficiency policies"

Renewable energy is a critical source of employment growth; in 2016, it was estimated that this sector was responsible for 8.1 million jobs globally. Projections INDICate that this figure may reach up to 20 million jobs by 2030: 2.1 million jobs in wind energy production, 6.3 million in solar photovoltaics and 12 million in biofuels-related agriculture and industry (OECD 2017).

GEO6_12_2,12,11,"Other examples of providing information to guide behaviour are labelling and branding. In this context, labelling refers to providing information on a product about its environmental impacts, such as its relative emissions or energy consumption, to inform consumers’ choices. Such labels may be required by government regulations (e.g. emissions and fuel economy estimates are required on the labels for new cars in the United States) or may be voluntarily provided by the manufacturer. Branding, in this context, involves associating a logo or symbol with a product or service that INDICates to consumers that the product or service has met some set criteria for environmental performance (e.g. Energy Star). Such brands have been established by governments, industry associations or public advocacy groups as voluntary programmes, and often involve independent testing."

GEO6_12_6,12,15,"As discussed in Chapter 5, atmospheric change (including air pollution, climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion and PBT pollution) is directly or indirectly related to each of the SDGs (see Figure 5.2). These issues are also addressed by a collection of global and regional MEAs, as well as policies at the national, provincial and municipal level. To evaluate the effectiveness or sufficiency of any given policy or suite of policies, it is useful to have measurable INDICATORs. Ideally, such INDICATORs should be sensitive to the policy changes of interest but not confounded by other influences. However, the INDICATOR should also be relatable to impacts of the policy change that society values. These two objectives point to either end of the DPSIR framework (Figure 1.2) used in the preceding chapters, suggesting that selecting one best INDICATOR is often a compromise. The compromise might be different if the intent is to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific policy (such as in the case studies above) versus the sufficiency of a suite of policies (including policies at different geographical scales)."
GEO6_12_7,12,15,"This section describes three INDICATORs of atmospheric change that are intended to track progress towards the SDGs and compare the sufficiency of existing policies at the national scale. The INDICATORs chosen focus on air pollution, stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change. The data available for emissions and concentrations of PBTs are not sufficient for evaluating the effectiveness of policies globally or at the national level."
GEO6_12_8,12,16,12.3.1 INDICATOR 1: Population-weighted annual mean concentration
GEO6_12_9,12,16,"Exposure to PM concentrations leads to a variety of human health impacts, including premature mortality. Weighting the average concentration by population distribution creates an INDICATOR that is focused on the concentrations to which people are exposed. Emissions of PM and its precursors come from a wide variety of anthropogenic sources, including electricity generation, transportation, residential combustion, industrial processes and agricultural burning. These sources can be managed using a wide variety of policy approaches. of PM concentration of PM in 2016 Other factors PM concentrations are also affected by weather, wildfires, windblown dust and volcanoes. Weather is subject to significant inter-annual variability, decadal cycles and long- term trends. The contributions of wildfires, windblown dust and volcanoes also vary from year to year. These influences must be accounted for when attributing observed trends to the impact of control policies."
GEO6_12_10,12,16,"Possible alternatives PM concentrations are well-accepted metrics for air pollution. WHO has established a guideline value and interim targets for maximum annual average PM concentrations. Under the SDGs, the population-weighted annual mean level of PM or PM was selected as an INDICATOR of progress towards sustainable cities. Weighting concentrations by the population exposed focuses the metric on the overall impact on the population. However, a population weighted average may mask the number of people exposed to the most extreme air pollution levels. Thus, absolute concentrations provide another alternative metric."
GEO6_12_11,12,16,"Direct emissions of PM and its gaseous precursors (including SO , NO and NH ) are alternative INDICATORs. Emissions are more directly affected by policy changes, but more distantly related to health impacts. For many sources, measurement of emissions is impractical, and estimates are highly uncertain."

GEO6_12_13,12,18,12.3.3 INDICATOR 3: Anthropogenic emissions of long-lived greenhouse
GEO6_12_14,12,18,"Policy relevance/causal chain Long-term climate change is primarily driven by emissions of GHGs, including CO , methane (CH ), nitrous oxide (N O) and fluorinated gases. The contribution of each of these pollutants to climate change can be compared in terms of CO equivalents using the Global Warming Potential (GWP) INDEX, which accounts for the pollutants’ different atmospheric lifetimes. GWPs are calculated for a specific time-horizon, with 100 years being the most common for comparing the impact of long-lived GHGs."
GEO6_12_15,12,18,"Anthropogenic emissions of GHGs come from a wide range of sources but are primarily associated with the production and consumption of energy, land-use change and deforestation. Different types of policies can directly or indirectly affect energy production and consumption behaviours and technologies and thus the generation of GHG emissions. Anthropogenic emissions are quantified and reported at the national level to the UNFCCC and provide an aggregate INDICATOR of the effectiveness of policies. Annual emissions data from 1990 to the present are available from the UNFCCC for industrialized countries or economies in transition (called Annex I Parties under the Convention). Under the Paris Agreement, all countries are required to submit emissions inventories every two years. Other factors In addition to policies, anthropogenic GHG emissions are also affected by economic, social and technological trends. GHG emissions are also generated by natural sources. Both natural and anthropogenic sources are affected by natural meteorological and climate variability. gases (CO equivalents) including land-use change and forestry sources and sinks The relationship between GHG emissions, radiative forcing, changes in climate and climate variability and downstream impacts on human health, ecosystems and infrastructure can be estimated using Earth system models that must account for a significant number of processes and feedbacks."

Some management tools used with the LMMA approach, such as periodically harvested Figure 13.2: Inshore fishing is an important source of food in Fiji, and many of these inshore areas are under traditional tenure by local communities closures, are not consistently effective for fish biomass and biodiversity outcomes (Jupiter et al. 2017). While the approach has spatially expanded dramatically in the absence of any alternative and is currently heavily relied on to achieve conservation and fisheries management outcomes in Fiji, there is no unequivocal evidence at present that it has been completely effective in terms of site-based biological outcomes. The approach has transformative potential, through promoting benefits based on a long-established community system strengthened by coherent resource management approaches."

GEO6_13_4,13,14,"Engaging communities in effective land use and management of natural ecosystems in urban areas can be beneficial to both residents and biodiversity and promote inclusive city governance. The involvement of different stakeholders at different scales and partnerships between experts from various disciplines (e.g. ecologists, urban designers, landscape architects) is also considered important for biodiversity conservation (Felson and Pickett 2005; Colding 2007). Progress is measurable: for example, the City Biodiversity INDEX, which “provides a monitoring tool to assist local authorities to evaluate their progress in urban biodiversity conservation, which can be further included in national reports” (CBD 2014). Various institutional arrangements and approaches take into account the importance of biodiversity in green areas. For example, in Italy health and well-being aspects (Carrus et al. 2015), in Brazil restoring Atlantic Forest in urban areas through municipal plans (Sansevero et al. 2017), and in Finland preservation of ecosystem services (Niemelä et al. 2010) are considered. Mainstreaming biodiversity requires the integration of biodiversity and environmental components and norms into sectoral policies, enabling stakeholders’ involvement. Within the DPSIR framework (Section 1.6), mainstreaming is a response made by a group of actors to address pressures and drivers such as habitat loss and fragmentation and human population pressure (Section 2.2). The Edmonton Natural Area System Policy shows how to engage local actors to mainstream biodiversity into the urban environment."

As an outcome of this policy, a strategic plan emerged for the conservation and restoration of Edmonton’s natural systems and the biodiversity they contain (Figure 13.6). Enabling actors and institutional arrangements in local and urban biodiversity conservation has been proven in certain cases to be successful when governments collaborate across different levels to enhance the quality of urban environments for ecological and social benefits. Extensive stakeholder participation on environmental management “may seem very risky, but there is growing evidence that if well designed, these perceived risks may be well worth taking” (Reed 2008). However, fiscal and budget prioritization remain serious challenges for the public administration. The Edmonton case study illustrates a successful implementation of the Protected Areas System Policy, securing 110ha/year of priority natural areas.

GEO6_13_10,13,17,"13.3.1 INDICATOR 1: Proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species (SDG INDICATOR 15.8.1) Invasive alien species (IAS) may threaten local biodiversity through direct and indirect competition, predation and habitat degradation, and as disease agents and vectors (Pejchar and Mooney 2009; Strayer 2010). They are considered the second greatest threat to biodiversity after land-use change and habitat loss (Section 6.4.2) (Wilcove et al. 1998; Bellard, Cassey and Blackburn 2016). This INDICATOR evaluates the “trends in policy responses, legislation and management plans to control and prevent spread of invasive alien species” (species that have been introduced to an area and have spread beyond the area of introduction) and the “proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species” (see methodology in Biodiversity INDICATORs Partnership 2018a) (Figure 13.7 and Figure 13.8). Policy relevance This INDICATOR directly tracks progress towards global multilateral environmental agreements, and in particular Target 9 of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

GEO6_13_11,13,18,"Causal relations A s more multilateral international agreements relevant to IAS are introduced (such as the Cartagena Protocol, the International Plant Protection Convention and the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization), the level of national commitment to related policies increases. This, in turn, reflects a greater global commitment to controlling IAS (Biodiversity INDICATORs Partnership 2018a). Those countries that are party to the CBD have agreed to Aichi Target 17, and policies related to the control of IAS should be addressed in their NBSAPs. This is an example of an international policy trigger and a top-down approach leading to the creation of national IAS regulations. A bottom-up causal relation (the creation of an IAS policy due to an increase in IAS within a country) is more difficult to demonstrate. Within national IAS-relevant policies, governments may use several policy instruments to reduce IAS. These responses can be quite varied and specific. The WfW programme in South Africa (Section 13.2.3) uses PES to encourage the removal of IAS from waterways by giving monetary incentives to local communities (Buch and Dixon 2009). Other nations may use CCPs, such as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland plant health policy that imposes strict regulations on and certifications for the import and moving of certain plants, seeds, organic matter and plant products to prevent the introduction and spread of harmful plant pathogens (UK Department for Environmental and Rural Affairs 2014), as well as Australia’s well-developed strategic plan (Australia, Invasive Species Council 2015). In addition, island nations may have stronger IAS policies, reflecting a higher presence of endemic species, and ports can be subjected to stronger regulation, such as the recent international Ships Ballast Water and Sediments policy (International Maritime Organization 2017). Other international and national policies may influence this INDICATOR, especially trade policies. As globalization progresses and international commerce creates new trade routes and markets, new opportunities are created for alien species to establish themselves in new areas (Meyerson and Mooney 2007; Seebens et al. 2015).

GEO6_13_15,13,18,"Scope and measurement The INDICATOR is determined from species-level data which may be analysed on several scales (country, region and/or global). The IUCN Red List assigns species to seven categories of relative extinction risk (Extinct to Least Concern, or ‘Data Deficient’ for poorly known species). This is done using quantitative criteria for species based on population size, area of distribution and rate of decline (Bubb et al. 2009). In the 2012 update, the IUCN Red List included assessments for 63,837 species, of which 19,817 were threatened with extinction (SCBD and IUCN 2018). An RLI of 1 means all species in that group are categorized as Least Concern, while an RLI of 0 means that all species in the group are Extinct (Bubb et al. 2009). Currently, an RLI can be calculated for birds, mammals, amphibians, corals and gymnosperms. To assess taxonomic groups that are poorly known and/or have a very large number of species, a sampling approach was developed in which 1,500 species are randomly chosen and assumed to represent the larger group (Baillie et al. 2008)."
GEO6_13_16,13,19,"2006; Almond et al. 2013). The resulting trend can be used to INDICate the degree to which consumption is sustainable and the impact of natural resource use is within safe ecological limits. A declining trend INDICates that current utilization is unsustainable (negative impact of utilization), while an upward trend means that human use of this group of species is sustainable (positive impact of utilization through measures to control or manage sustainably) (Birdlife International 2012). Policy relevance The RLI (impacts of utilization) is directly related to Target 4 of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. It is also directly related to several targets within SDGs 8, 12, 14 and 15 (Biodiversity INDICATORs Partnership 2018b; UNEP 2015)."
GEO6_13_17,13,19,"Causal relations Policies that limit the utilization or promote sustainable management of species have the potential to directly impact this INDICATOR, though there is little to no published literature demonstrating policy effectiveness. The lack of evidence for policy impact may be partly because the average time for species status to improve by one Red List category is 16 years (Young et al. 2014). However, this INDICATOR should be sensitive to economic changes or policies that increase or decrease the price of a species-derived product. For example, a higher market price creates an incentive for greater use of a species by the manufacturer or hunter and, therefore, can put that group of species at greater risk of extinction, reflected in a lower RLI (Ayling 2013). It has been shown that CCPs, such as CITES international trade bans and regulations on poaching products from endangered species, can fail when there are strong economic incentives to continue poaching (Rivalan et al. 2007; Conrad 2012). Policies that instead focus on incentivizing and building capacity within communities to sustainably manage wildlife (e.g. as showcased in the Project Predator case study, Section 13.2.2) can decrease the long-term use of and demand for species (Challender and MacMillan 2014), effectively increasing the RLI (impact of utilization). Similarly, modelling has shown that more effective management of protected areas (i.e. design of protected areas, adequacy and appropriateness of management, delivery of objectives; SCBD 2018c) can have a greater positive impact on the RLI than only expanding protected areas (Costelloe et al. 2016)."
GEO6_13_18,13,19,13.3.3 INDICATOR 3: Ecological footprint
GEO6_13_19,13,19,"The Ecological Footprint, or Ecological Footprint Accounting, “compares human demand on nature against biocapacity, or nature’s supply” and capacity to regenerate (Rees and Wackernagel 1996). “Demand is measured by the biologically productive area a human population uses for producing the natural resources it consumes and absorbing its waste.” Biocapacity is measured in surface area (Biodiversity INDICATORs Partnership 2018c). The Ecological Footprint is measured “by taking the amount of biologically productive land and water area, or biocapacity that is required to produce the food, fibre and renewable raw materials an individual, population or activity consumes”. It also takes into account the materials needed to absorb carbon dioxide emissions generated (Global Footprint Network 2018). The Ecological Footprint uses an area- equivalent unit called global hectares (gha); 1 gha represents a biologically productive hectare with world average productivity (Galli 2015). The Ecological Footprint encompasses production and consumption, and each of these comprises the cropland, grazing, forest product, carbon and fish footprints, as well as built-up land (Global Footprint Network 2018). As a population’s pressure on biodiversity grows, so does its Ecological Footprint"

Although guidelines for the litter scheme have been developed, and the majority of Mediterranean fishermen have INDICated a willingness to participate, country surveys INDICate that vessels do not have bins or bags on board to store litter items. Fishermen continue to discard unwanted fishing gear into the sea (UNEP 2016). In this regard, a wide range of technologies for marking ownership of fishing gear are available. In fact, Moroccan and EU fisheries laws provide for the marking of both the vessel and the fishing gear carried on board (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2005), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations adopted the Guidelines on Marking Fishing Gear in 2018."
GEO6_14_2,14,14,14.3 INDICATORs The case studies analysed above provided insights into challenges and opportunities for policy design and implementation in responding to key contemporary threats to the oceans. Further insights may be gained by examining policy-sensitive INDICATORs relating to these threats.

GEO6_14_4,14,14,"Current projections INDICate that 7.3 per cent of the world’s oceans have been designed as MPAs (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2018). Sala et al. (2018) argue that these projections are overestimated, given that they include areas that are yet to exclude significant extractive activities. Their projection INDICates that the actual coverage of MPAs is 3.6 per cent, and only 2 per cent is being strongly or fully protected (Sala et al. 2018). In any case, while MPA coverage has been increasing (Figure 14.1), additional efforts are required to meet the internationally agreed targets."

Further, some coastal MPAs are also recognized as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Casual relation MPAs are a key conservation and management tool, particularly in the context of biodiversity and fisheries. They are part of area-based approaches, such as integrated coastal zone management and marine spatial planning. MPAs have the potential to address several pressures relating to marine biodiversity, including overfishing and habitat destruction. They help protect areas of ecological importance and ensure the provision of ecosystem services (e.g. fisheries, coastal protection, tourism and recreation) (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2017), with important implications for human health and well-being (Kareiva and Mavier 2012). Further, MPAs have increasingly been promoted as a strategy to enhance the resilience of ecosystems to climate change (McLeod et al. 2009; Simard et al. 2016). Accordingly, the MPAs INDICATOR addresses multiple issues identified in Chapter 7 of this report, particularly those relating to fisheries and climate change. Chapter 7 also recommends that, in the case of coral bleaching, reef-owning nations should consider taking immediate action (including establishing MPAs) to protect all known coral reef habitat from any non-subsistence uses (see Section 7.5.2)."
GEO6_14_6,14,14,"Caveats MPAs vary according to their management objective; they range from wholly biodiversity-focused MPAs to those incorporating human use (Dudley 2008). Accordingly, their contribution to achieving ocean conservation targets may vary. Further, the coverage of MPAs alone does not INDICate that such areas are effectively and equitably managed. Efforts to develop methods for evaluating the effectiveness of MPAs are, therefore, critical. Examples of these methods include Protected Area Management Effectiveness and the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (Stolton et al. 2007; Coad et al. 2015)."
GEO6_14_7,14,14,14.3.2 INDICATOR 2: Beach litter assessment
GEO6_14_8,14,15,"Policy relevance Although ‘floating plastic debris density’ was chosen as one of the INDICATORs for SDG target 14.1: “By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution”, it has been argued by many that beach litter should complement it. Many of the Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans have agreed on beach litter as their core INDICATOR for marine litter."
GEO6_14_9,14,15,"Various protocols outline the basic structure of the survey, the analysis of sampling units, the frequency and timing of surveys, the systems used for litter classification and the underpinning framework for facilitation and management of logistics. The data on beach litter generated through such standardized methodology can be useful for setting and achieving policy targets. Causal relation Beach litter originates from various sources; beach cleanup 14 and monitoring programmes (such as Clean up Australia and the United Kingdom’s Marine Conservation Society campaigns) have defined ‘item INDICATORs’ to address the sources of litter. Some beaches will better INDICate specific sources of litter than others due to their location (remote beaches or urban beaches tracking ship and urban pollution, respectively). Many studies dedicated to local beaches surveys and litter collection provide information on litter and tourism (UNEP/MAP 2015c). However, seasonal variations are common. While beach users were the main source of summer debris, litter in the tourist low season was primarily attributed to drainage and outfall systems. Other sources include floating litter washed ashore, coastal urbanization, wind-borne litter and illegal dumping. Changes in oceanographic (e.g. currents) and weather (e.g. storms) conditions may affect quantities of beach litter washed ashore. Other influencing factors The benefits of using beach litter as an INDICATOR include the possibility to include citizen science (the participation of non-professional scientists in a scientific project). Because the technique is relatively simple, volunteers are able to participate in the quantification and monitoring of seasonal and site-specific beach litter (Rosevelt et al. 2013; van der Velde et al. 2017; Vincent et al. 2017). Furthermore, beach surveys provide a mechanism for education and building community understanding and awareness. For example, public participation in the cleaning campaigns is strong in the Mediterranean Sea. Comprehensive and regular surveys of marine litter on beaches have been made in many areas, often over a number of years, by various NGOs in the region (UNEP/MAP 2015c)."
GEO6_14_10,14,15,"It can be difficult to draw conclusions regarding the overall increase or decrease of beach litter if variables change every year, including the number of volunteers participating in beach cleanups. More fundamentally, beach surveys may not relate to true marine pollution; because they may be affected by weather, the stranded debris may not necessarily provide a good INDICATOR of changes in overall abundance (UNEP/MAP 2015c)."

GEO6_14_12,14,16,"This INDICATOR measures the number of marine ecosystems that have been identified as vulnerable to impacts from fishing activities and are protected by RFMOs (Figure 14.2). This INDICATOR serves as a complement to the stock status INDICATORs (e.g. references to FAO State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA) reports) used in Chapter 7. It relates to a debate in wider policy literature on how to protect biodiversity. Although some approaches prefer sectoral regulation, such as on fisheries, mining or shipping, others (such as that underlying this INDICATOR) advocate complete protection of biodiversity and habitats from all threats regardless of sector. VMEs are identified by an internationally agreed process that can be found in paragraph 42 of the International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas (FAO 2009) and entail a management response that is generally embedded in the management process of RFMOs."
GEO6_14_13,14,16,"Caveats Banning destructive fishing practices in VMEs may not guarantee their preservation. Lost driftnets, marine litter, ocean acidification and eutrophication can all affect VMEs, even if they are protected from destructive fishing practices. Further, relying on protected VMEs as an INDICATOR potentially disregards important, unprotected VMEs. However, compared to terrestrial ecosystems, data on marine biodiversity remain limited (Martin et al. 2015). IUCN’s Red List of Ecosystems (IUCN 2017) provides a third-party attempt to catalogue ecosystems, including marine ecosystems, that are most vulnerable. The goal is to have all ecosystems assessed"
GEO6_14_14,14,18,"Last, there is an apparent lack of explicit consideration of the policies and INDICATORs examined regarding human health and well-being. For example, the establishment of MPAs which might restrict access rights of traditional coastal populations may have negative impacts on their livelihood, food security and health. Likewise, the impact of increasingly warmer oceans may result in more frequent phytoplankton blooms, some of which relate to shellfish and fish poisoning and conditions conducive to cholera outbreaks (Cinner et al. 2016). These and other health and well-being implications need to be considered as part of ocean policies, if the goal of a ‘healthy planet, healthy people’ is to be achieved."

GEO6_15_4,15,18,"15.3.1 INDICATOR 1: Proportion of land degraded over total land The expansion of human economic activities and the competing interest for land resources have dramatically increased the pressure on land and on terrestrial ecosystems (Figure 15.3) and in some cases accentuated political conflicts at local level (Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development [OECD] 2017). Estimates of global land degradation show that about 25 per cent of all land is degraded, 36 per cent is slightly or moderately degraded, while 10 per cent is improving (FAO 2011; IPBES 2018b). The unit of measurement of this INDICATOR is the area (ha or km ) of land that is degraded divided by the total land (UNCCD 2017b). This INDICATOR is measured by adding all those areas that are subject to change, and whose conditions are considered as negative by national authorities when measuring and evaluating each of the following three sub-INDICATORs: land cover and land cover change,"
GEO6_15_5,15,18,"The INDICATOR is linked to several targets and commitments that have been agreed by global, regional and national governments to halt and reverse land degradation and restore degraded land (IPBES 2018b).

GEO6_15_6,15,18,"The INDICATOR addresses the nature of land degradation, which is expressed as “the reduction in the capacity of land to provide ecosystem goods and services over a period of time for its beneficiaries” (Nachtergaele et al. 2011; Zdruli 2014). Land degradation has direct impacts on the capacity for net biomass primary production, but socioeconomic factors play a major role in its occurrence – such as the link between urbanization and its related soil and air pollution (Prasad and Badarinth 2004; Seto, Güneralpa and Hutyra 2012). In other cases, socioeconomic factors have hindered efforts to cope with land degradation (Lubwama 1999; Chasek et al. 2011). This is the case of urban sprawl or the expansion of solar panels promoted by renewable energy policies and lack of well-defined land-use planning guidelines that have accelerated these types of land-use changes at the expense of fertile soils that otherwise should be used for food production or preservation of nature-based contributions to people (Diaz et al. 2018)."

GEO6_15_8,15,19,"15.3.2 INDICATOR 2: Terrestrial protected areas as a percentage of total land area Since the mid-1990s, growing concerns over environmental degradation have led to the current emphasis on the roles that nature plays in maintaining societies (Butchart et al. 2015; Diaz et al. 2018). In recognition of the significance of this, 193 Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted the 20 Aichi Targets to be met by 2020. Aichi biodiversity target 11 is of particular relevance and commits to a 1.6 per cent increase (from 15.4 per cent to at least 17 per cent) in protected areas by 2020 (CBD 2010). This could also contribute to reducing the loss of natural habitats (target 5), reducing human-induced species decline and extinction (target 12), and maintaining global carbon stocks (target 15). Countries have since agreed on the SDGs’ targets (United Nations 2015) for 2020 and beyond, and this is likely to drive the agenda on protected terrestrial areas in the coming decades (Allen et al. 2016). SDG 15 specifically refers to land resources and their management."
GEO6_15_9,15,19,"This INDICATOR measures the proportion of terrestrial protected areas as a share of the total land area expressed as a percentage (United Nations 2015). The purpose of the INDICATOR is to represent the extent to which terrestrial areas that offer ecosystem value in terms of conserving biodiversity, cultural heritage, scientific research, recreation and other valuable uses are protected, in their diversity and integrity, from unsustainable land uses (United Nations 2015)."
GEO6_15_10,15,19,The INDICATOR is calculated using all the nationally designated protected areas recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) (United Nations Environment
GEO6_15_11,15,19,"Figure 15.4: Terrestrial protected area as a percentage Terrestrial Protected area as a percentage World Conservation Monitoring Centre 2018). World Bank (2017) data show that the surface area of protected areas for the period 1990-2014 increased from 8.2 per cent to 14.8 per cent, INDICating a positive trend reflecting the implementation of national and international policies for them (Figure 15.4). Governance of protected areas, in particular primary forests, is particularly relevant because evidence points to the impacts of agricultural output prices on deforestation rates both inside and outside of protected areas (Deiro and Escobar 2012). Assunção, Gadour and Rocha (2015), in a study in the Amazon, found high correlations between deforestation rates and agricultural output prices, while Deiro and Escobar (2012) point out that “between 1981 and 2010 an area of 45,000,000 hectares was downgraded or lost with almost 70 per cent of cases occurring since 2008”. The authors (Deiro and Escobar 2012), however, conclude that changes in conservation policies implemented between 2004 and 2008 significantly contributed to the curbing of deforestation rates. Location is another key influencing factor affecting protected areas. Joppa and Pfaff (2009) note that “the positioning of protected areas is not random; they are often located in areas that are inaccessible or unsuitable for agriculture, in remote and topographically challenging areas without transport links, such that they are unlikely to be under pressure from the developmental drivers of land use change”."
GEO6_15_12,15,19,"In general, there is scientific and political consensus, as well as precedence and agreement, on this INDICATOR. However, evidence of the impacts of market prices, management effectiveness and factors specific to other sites have since led to the proposal to incorporate INDICATORs that aid in the measurement of protected area conditions and/ or management effectiveness, including more equitable management and representative INDICATORs of spatial coverage (e.g. forest area as a percentage of land area). of total land area per country (1990-2014) of total land area per country"
GEO6_15_13,15,20,"15.3.3 INDICATOR 3: Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth In 2016, about 54.5 per cent of the global (human) population lived in urban areas and by 2030, the United Nations predicts that 60 per cent of the global population will be urban (United Nations 2016a). The total increase in urban population between 2000 and 2020 is estimated at 1.48 billion, of which 1.35 billion will be concentrated in less-developed regions (United Nations 2012). As population growth increasingly consumes available land, cities expand far beyond their formal administrative boundaries and urban sprawl is visible around them (United Nations Human Settlements Programme [UN- Habitat] 2017). Land consumption rate is computed as a function of: (a) “The expansion of built-up area which can be directly measured; (b) the absolute extent of land that is subject to exploitation by agriculture, forestry or other economic activities; and (c) the over-intensive exploitation of land that is used for agriculture and forestry” (United Nations 2015). Population growth rate shows the increase of population in a country during a certain period, typically one year, expressed as a percentage of the population at the start of that period (World Bank 2017).

UN-Habitat therefore proposed a minor revision of INDICATOR 11.3.1 to “Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate, including the term Efficient land use”, where if the ratio is equal to or smaller than 1 it is qualified as efficient.

The INDICATORs are relevant to key interconnected international goals such as the SDGs and provide evidence of progress towards meeting the policy objectives. For instance, INDICATOR 2 on terrestrial protected areas as a percentage of total land area is connected to Aichi Biodiversity Targets 13, 11 and 5 and is also relevant to SDG 15 and its respective targets."
GEO6_15_17,15,21,"The case studies also INDICate that evaluation of policy effectiveness in most cases has been commissioned by external stakeholders, while national governments that are often involved in policy design have not shown serious interest in policy evaluation. Land policy evaluation is important as it will provide significant lessons that can be useful in the refinement of policies and implementation of strategies."
GEO6_15_18,15,22,"One obvious gap is the fact that most national land policies are not linked to international goals. This is important, especially from the point of view of the SDGs, when viewed against the background that the implementation of such policies will have little or no contribution to the attainment of international goals. The Kyoto Protocol did not even mention relation to the role of land and soil in climate change dynamics. When national governments ratify international conventions, it is important that these are backed up with relevant national policies accompanied by baseline INDICATORs to track progress towards reaching policy goals."
GEO6_16_1,16,4,"In particular for transboundary rivers, agreements have become more comprehensive and more numerous over time, reflecting an integrated approach to managing shared rivers and lakes (Giordano et al. 2014). By 2007, there were 250 freshwater treaties and 30 additional treaties are established every decade (Giordano et al. 2014), mostly focusing on water quality and the environment. However, obligations, responsibilities and enforcement mechanisms to address water quality have typically been left undefined (Giordano et al. 2014). Regulatory agreements have tended to exclude direct data- and information-exchange mechanisms (Gerlak, Lautze and Giordano 2011). These trends combined INDICate that while water quality may be regarded as important, specific policy interventions have been hard to establish. River basin organizations (RBOs) for transboundary water bodies can be vehicles of treaty implementation. In general, the main functions of RBOs are (i) data gathering, monitoring and regulation; (ii) river basin planning; and (iii) development of infrastructure and facilities (Global Water Partnership [GWP] 2017). Many RBOs are guided by IWRM principles that seek to achieve efficiency, equity and ecological sustainability, while also addressing water quality and quantity issues. Within the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Response (DPSIR) framework (Section 1.6), this institutional approach is aimed at identifying pressures that cause water quality degradation, reasonable and equitable water use and ecosystem concerns."
GEO6_16_2,16,6,"The degree to which the 43 originally identified ‘areas of concern’ (AOC) have been addressed over time can INDICate policy progress (Figure 16.1). The removal of 7 of the original AOC INDICates a degree of success, although the 36 remaining areas highlight the difficulty of such remedial actions. As biophysical change may take decades to achieve in an AOC, a more immediate measure of policy progress is the adoption and implementation of policies to protect the Great Lakes in the areas in which specific remediation measures are undertaken."
GEO6_16_3,16,6,"Canadian and U.S. in the Great Legend The costs of the extensive monitoring, analysis and remediation of Great Lakes water quality issues are substantial. For instance, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, launched in 2010 to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes, has provided funds for projects amounting to more than US$2.3 billion for the future functioning of the initiative (US EPA 2017). The efforts to enhance habitat for the fisheries include the removal of hundreds of small dams and culverts that partially or fully impede fish movement for spawning (Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). While economically a relatively minor activity, dam and culvert removal have an important impact on the aquatic life of the lakes and contribute to recreational value to the lake-side population. On the other hand, the removal of dams and culverts allows for spawning of some of the most aggressive invasive species in the lake, a side effect of the policy that requires a scientific assessment. The optimization models used by Neeson et al. (2015) INDICate that the most cost-effective way of managing the Great Lakes restoration is when dams and road crossings are removed across the whole basin. The basin-wide approach results in doubling the habitat of fish species at a cost of US$70 million, whereas a less integrated approach of addressing only dams or only road of America and Canadian Great Lakes Areas of Areas of Concern Lakes Basin"
GEO6_16_4,16,14,"Mining requires significant amounts of water and presents considerable short- and long-term risks to water resources (Spitz and Trudinger 2008) (see also Section 9.5.5). The potential impacts on existing users and values of water resources are a common concern for local communities faced with both large- and small-scale mining projects. Such concerns stem from experiences of mines that have caused (or continue to cause) pollution or other impacts on water resources (e.g. reductions in stream flows, declines in groundwater levels, river diversions, undesirable changes in quality). Governments, companies and communities have recognized the fundamental need for the mining industry to manage water resource-related risks effectively (e.g. Norgate and Lovel 2006; Rankin 2011). The main protocol for sustainability reporting is the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which began in 1997 as a coalition of government, community and corporate stakeholders, and aimed to make sustainability reporting as commonplace and important as corporate reporting. The current GRI standard includes a wide range of INDICATORs across social, economic, environmental and local-community health aspects, and was designed to be used not only by the mining sector, but by any company or organization. It addresses equity issues through providing guidance on reporting on management approaches affecting vulnerable groups, the means by which local stakeholders are identified and engaged with, and the means by which companies address risks to and impacts on local communities. Since the Johannesburg Earth Summit in 2002, the global mining industry, through the International Council of Mining and Metals, now requires their corporate members to publish annual sustainability reports. Case study: Australian mining industry’s Water Accounting Framework Early research into the water data reported by mines found that data in sustainability reporting could be changed from year to year without explanation, that different mines interpreted terms such as ‘consumed water’ or ‘recycled water’ inconsistently, and that water quality issues were poorly addressed (Mudd 2008; Northey et al. 2016). This led the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) to develop the Water Accounting Framework (MCA 2012), which allows a mine’s water balance to be quantified and the specific Global Reporting Initiative INDICATORs to be reported through sustainability reports. The Water Accounting Framework was a major step forward in providing a consistent reporting approach to water management for mines. The 49-member companies of the MCA represent 85 per cent of Australia’s mining activity and more than 90 per cent of mineral exports (MCA 2017a)."
GEO6_16_5,16,14,"Furthermore, there are very few formal evaluations of water data and information published in sustainability reports, except for a limited number of academic studies. With the Global Reporting Initiative moving to a standards framework rather than a guideline structure, independent auditing and assurance are now more prominent, as well as being important for responsible investors, regulators and interested community stakeholders. The effectiveness of the policy in terms of the impact of mining operations on water resources generally has not yet been rigorously evaluated. However, the large proportion of Australian mining companies publishing sustainability reports incorporating the Water Accounting Framework suggests that the approach is useful as a management tool. 16.3 INDICATORs (link to SDGs and MEAs) The following INDICATORs on access to drinking water, sanitation and water withdrawal further examine the variety of policies used in managing freshwater resources, contributing to improving human health through various pathways.

GEO6_16_6,16,15,16.3.1 INDICATOR 1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services
GEO6_16_7,16,15,"SDG INDICATOR 6.1.1 is defined as the proportion of the population worldwide using safely managed drinking water services, in support of public health. ‘Safely managed’ refers to water from an improved water source located on mining industry’s Water Accounting Framework premises, available when needed and free of faecal and priority chemical contamination (WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF] 2017), wherein ‘improved water source’ (the MDG INDICATOR) includes rainwater, water that is piped, made available from taps, standpipes, boreholes, wells or springs, or is packaged or delivered. ‘Drinking water services’ refers to the accessibility, availability and quality of the main source used by households for drinking, cooking, personal hygiene and other domestic uses (WHO and UNICEF 2017). Priority chemical contaminants vary by country, but arsenic and fluoride are assigned as priority contaminants globally due to their potential impacts on human health."
GEO6_16_8,16,16,"Scope and measurement From 2000 to 2015, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund (WHO/UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) used a binary classification of improved/unimproved sources of drinking water as an INDICATOR for monitoring and evaluation purposes. In order to monitor SDG target 6.1, the JMP further developed this INDICATOR to facilitate further differentiation between service levels and assessment of safe management of supplies (WHO and UNICEF 2017). Corresponding updates were made to the JMP drinking water service ladders with ‘safely managed’ occupying a new rung positioned at the top (Table 16.8)."
GEO6_16_9,16,16,"According to the JMP, 2.6 billion people worldwide gained access to an improved source of drinking water in the period between 1990 and 2015 (UNICEF and WHO 2015) (Figure 16.2). This brought the proportion of the global population using piped water supplies on premises to approximately 75 per cent. Policy relevance This INDICATOR is a modification of the MDG INDICATOR 7.8 (proportion of population using an improved drinking water source) and directly relates to SDG target 6.1, which aims to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030. This INDICATOR also relates to long-standing global policy efforts addressing water and human health, including multilateral environmental agreements such as the 1999 Protocol on Water and Health."
GEO6_16_10,16,16,Possible alternative INDICATORs A useful alternative INDICATOR to understand the population benefiting from safely managed drinking water services might focus on disparities between rural and urban populations combined with wealth quintiles. The JMP has been able to track coverage between 1995 and 2012 (UNICEF and WHO 2015) but

GEO6_16_12,16,17,"SDG INDICATOR 6.2.1 refers to the proportion of the population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand- washing facility with soap and water, wherein ‘safely managed’ is defined as “an improved sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where: excreta is safely disposed of in situ, or excreta is transported and treated off- site” (WHO 2017, p. 1)."
GEO6_16_13,16,17,"Graphical representation There has been great progress made in decreasing the number of people without access to safe sanitation services. As Figure 16.3 shows, between 2000 and 2015 the number of people practising open defecation declined from 1,229 million to 892 million, which is an average reduction of 22 million people per year. Furthermore, all regions have made progress in decreasing this INDICATOR apart from sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. source, 1990-2015 (billions)"
GEO6_16_14,16,18,"Policy relevance The proportion of the population using safely managed sanitation services directly relates to the SDG target 6.2: “by 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations” (United Nations 2018). SDG INDICATOR 6.2.1 increases recognition of these relationships and furthers ongoing global efforts to address water and sanitation, including the MDGs preceding this SDG target, as well as the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Causal relations Improved water supply and sanitation are the most fundamental INDICATORs related to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions. Policy interventions have aimed to provide and maintain infrastructure such as wells, water transport and distribution networks, and water-treatment facilities (Hunt 2011). Water quality interventions and hygiene promotion such as handwashing have also been effective in prevention of disease (Peletz et al. 2013)."
GEO6_16_15,16,18,"Possible alternative INDICATORs The concomitant rise in pit-latrine sanitation and groundwater use has led to increasing concerns about the potential impact of resulting contamination of drinking water on health. In order to measure the robustness of sanitation service hygienically separating excreta from human contact, consideration may be required to not simply measure the sanitation service provision but also any secondary or knock-on effects. INDICATORs based on integrated data to identify and mitigate risk could be useful and it has been suggested that water supply and pit- latrine mapping is effective, as well as the monitoring of key groundwater contamination INDICATORs (Back et al. 2018)."
GEO6_16_16,16,18,16.3.3 INDICATOR 3: Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources
GEO6_16_17,16,18,"SDG INDICATOR 6.4.2 refers to level of water stress (freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources). Water withdrawal can be defined as the amount of freshwater resources removed from rivers or aquifers for agricultural, industrial and domestic uses (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2016). Agricultural water use makes up the majority of global water withdrawal, underscoring a major dimension of the water-food nexus (2000-2015) among countries where at least with basic sanitation services, 2015"
GEO6_16_18,16,19,"(see Sections 4.4.3 and 9.8.2) with consequences for livelihoods, nutrition, public health and well-being. Agricultural water withdrawal is used for irrigation, livestock and aquaculture (FAO 2016). In particular, irrigation makes up the majority of total water withdrawal (67 per cent) (United Nations World Water Assessment Programme [WWAP] 2016). Scope and measurement Water withdrawal trends INDICate how human use of fresh water has changed over time. At the global level, over the last century water withdrawal has increased (Figure 16.5). The changes to blue water withdrawal suggest how irrigation has increased over time. The ratio of agricultural water withdrawal to total water withdrawal within a country varies across the globe with factors such as climate and priority given to agricultural activity (Figure 16.6). The development of dams has contributed to anthropogenic water use and evaporation from storage of water in lakes or reservoirs. However, this type of water withdrawal is not currently reflected in the INDICATOR discussed in this section (FAO 2016)."
GEO6_16_19,16,20,"Policy relevance This INDICATOR is directly relevant to SDG target 6.4: By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of fresh water to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity. Concerns over water quantity have been repeatedly raised in global policies and numerous multinational environmental agreements such as the 1977 Mar del Plata Action Plan, 1992 Dublin Statement of Water and Sustainable Development, the 1997 Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (United Nations Watercourses Convention), the 1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (UNECE Water Convention), and the International Law Commission’s 2008 Draft Articles on the Law of Transboundary Aquifers. In addition, this INDICATOR also draws attention to the balance between water for agriculture and water for industrial, household and ecosystem needs, which is addressed specifically in SDG target 6.5 advocating integrated water resources management (IWRM). Causal relations Subsidies are a major contributor to the expansion of irrigation agriculture. Full cost recovery rarely happens in developed countries. In developing countries, water user associations have been set up to decrease use of subsidies and charge for water use. However, such charges are not sufficient to meet full cost recovery (Toan 2016). Consequently, the price of irrigation undermines supply cost and disregards impacts on the environment. It has been suggested that the ‘polluter pays’ principle should be included in the price of irrigation (Howarth 2009). While large-scale public investment in irrigation has been made in the past, it is unlikely for investments at such scale to be made in future. Instead, participatory irrigation management and irrigation management transfer are providing investment at the local scale and proving very popular (Turral et al. 2010). Groundwater is increasingly used for agricultural purposes (Figure 16.7). In particular, private groundwater wells and abstraction have become the main method for irrigation in India and are used widely in other developing countries such as China, Pakistan and Thailand (Turral et al. 2010). Here, the water-energy nexus is evident as cheaper pumping technology and easier energy access has enabled extraction, often at the individual level (Shah 2014). However, groundwater governance, especially for transboundary aquifers, has yet to be well established (Albrecht et al. 2017). There are also reported cases where efforts to improve irrigation efficiency have not contributed to the reduction of groundwater use, but rather the opposite (Pfeiffer and Lin 2014). Other influencing factors Molden et al. (2010) suggest supply management focusing on allocation has had a bigger impact on water efficiency than pricing to influence the behaviour of farmers. However, in large river systems, supply management through dams can lead to increased irrigation activity whereby dam-impacted catchments have 25 times more economic activity per unit of water compared with non-impacted catchments (Nilsson et al. 2005)."
GEO6_16_20,16,20,"Possible alternative INDICATORs Vörösmarty et al. (2010) examined the ways human water security and biodiversity threats intersect globally. An INDICATOR of these composite factors shows effects not only water withdrawals but also downstream and on ecosystems, beyond meeting water needs for agricultural output. Alternative INDICATORs could provide insight into water scarcity at the subnational level. Considering that water scarcity is experienced at local level, alternative INDICATORs could cover the spatial variation of water scarcity within countries. There are some emerging concepts and methodologies, for example the World Resources Institute Aqueduct water risk mapping makes detailed data accessible to a range of users including investors and companies (https://www.wri.org/our-work/ project/aqueduct)."
GEO6_17_1,17,5,"In undertaking this assessment, four sustainability challenges are examined through the lens of specific case studies which highlight challenges and opportunities for policy design and implementation. This chapter also provides broader insights on the effectiveness of cross-cutting environmental policies by examining policy-sensitive INDICATORs. 17.3 Adapting socioeconomic systems to be more resilient to climate change"
GEO6_17_2,17,8,17.3.4 INDICATORs
GEO6_17_3,17,8,"INDICATORs play a critical role in the monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation. The INDICATORs for SDG 13, ‘Climate action’, do not provide the most direct measurement of adaptation effectiveness. The level to which the CCA action contributes to achieving SDG 5 (achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls) and SDG 10 (reducing inequality within and among countries) are also important INDICATORs of success."
GEO6_17_4,17,8,"Scientific frameworks for measuring vulnerability, resilience and adaptive capacities along with INDICATORs have been developed (e.g. Cutter, Boruff and Shirley 2003; Turner et al. 2003; Wisner et al. 2004; Hinkel et al. 2012; Taylor 2017). Examples of INDICATORs to measure effective adaptation efforts for coastal cities can include identifying the amount of land area known to have (in)sufficient infrastructure, reducing the number of residents living in floodplains or low-elevation coastal zones, or developing a network of communication channels in times of crisis or disaster. For SIDS, INDICATORs for adaptation include measures to respond to decreases in available fresh water (drought-resistant vegetation, water- saving devices, establishing buffer zones to protect catchment areas), prevention and removal of maladaptive practices (amend policies that lead to destruction of mangroves, laws preventing recycling of water, or allowing building in vulnerable areas), and address impacts of climate change on biodiversity and land degradation (land-use models for efficient farming, sustainable fishing practices, raising community awareness) (United Nations 2015). Some considerations for achieving more transformational change – and ensuring effective adaptation measures – include consideration of scale (using a landscape- or basin-scale approach, and distinguishing between short-, medium- and long-term strategies), community participation, novel approaches to adaptation (e.g. the use of crop insurance in developing countries, building market resilience to climate change), and those that transform places or shift locations (artificial islands combined with relocation, and new institutions and funding mechanisms for reduced vulnerability) (Kates, Travis and Wilbanks 2012). Vulnerability and capacity assessments (VCA) together with climate risk screening and assessment are necessary to ensure that future development programmes consider impacts of climate change – see, for example, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies VCA (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies n.d.), and Climate and the Disaster Risk Screening tool from the World Bank (World Bank 2018), or UNDP Report on stocktake of climate risks screening tool (Olhoff and Schaer 2010). 17.4 Creating a sustainable agrifood system"
GEO6_17_5,17,9,"While there is considerable national experience in applying the polluter pays principle to carbon emissions in the energy sector via emissions trading schemes and carbon taxes, agriculture remains excluded from such initiatives. Monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions in agriculture is considerably more complex and costly than for energy, because greenhouse gas emissions occur at the landscape scale according to farming practices and agroecological context. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily present an insurmountable barrier. For example, in New Zealand, the agricultural sector reports its greenhouse gas emissions without being part of the national emissions trading scheme, INDICating that it is possible to quantify and account for emissions from agriculture."
GEO6_17_6,17,11,17.4.5 INDICATORs
GEO6_17_7,17,11,"Many existing INDICATORs – such as agricultural emissions from different farming sectors – provide valuable information on the environmental sustainability of different parts of the food system, and others are still under development (e.g. SDG INDICATOR 2.4.1 ‘Proportion of agricultural area under productive food loss and waste, consumption usually focused on productive aspects of the food system and tend not to show the efficiency or transformation of the system as a whole. To achieve this we propose a new policy-sensitive national-level INDICATOR for the sustainability and nutrient efficiency of national dietary outcomes: dietary health and sustainability. The dietary health and sustainability INDICATOR would be based on existing annual data series and measure the gap between national consumption patterns and national healthy and sustainable nutritional guidelines. However, as already noted, very few countries currently have nationally defined guidelines on the composition of healthy and sustainable diets. In the absence of such guidelines, alternative global values could be derived from the forthcoming"
GEO6_17_8,17,12,"Planet, Health, which intends to reach scientific consensus on what defines a healthy and sustainable diet (EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health 2018; Springmann et al. 2018).). The EAT-Lancet Commission recommendations could also be the basis of an aggregate global INDICATOR."
GEO6_17_9,17,12,"If reliable national data on consumption are unavailable, the dietary health and sustainability INDICATOR would use existing FAO Food Balance Sheet (FBS) data that include annual estimates of national food supplies per capita for each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities that are potentially available for human consumption. However, the FBS data are somewhat crude. The categories are summed to a high level, limiting the level of detail at which analysis can be conducted. Nor do they capture the nature of the food consumed, including whether it is heavily processed – which can have important health implications. Given these shortcomings, governments would be encouraged to gather more accurate data on national consumption patterns as well as to develop nationally appropriate guidelines for healthy and sustainable diets that better reflect the national context."
GEO6_17_10,17,12,"A value of zero represents ‘ideal’ consumption, negative values represent underconsumption and positive values show overconsumption. For example, if there were recommended intake values for the food groups in Table 17.2, the dietary health and sustainability INDICATOR would express each country’s supply in relative terms (Figure 17.2)."
GEO6_17_11,17,12,"The FBS data show the quantities of food available to the population after accounting for exports and imports, other uses (livestock feed, seed, non-food uses), and losses during storage and transportation. Therefore, the dietary health and sustainability INDICATOR would provide a useful high-level picture of the performance of policies and measures across the entire food system, including actions to reorient agricultural production, trade measures, actions to reduce pre-household waste, and nutritional policies. It would provide an integrated measure of the agrifood system’s contributions to progress against multiple SDGs."
GEO6_17_12,17,12,"Since this proposed dietary health and sustainability INDICATOR is consumption-based, it would not fully reflect the impact of agricultural policies in countries that are large net exporters of agricultural goods, or which produce significant proportions of non-food agricultural products. For example, a country’s consumption may appear to be healthy and sustainable, but if consumption is largely based on imported foods, this provides no INDICation of the sustainability of the agricultural system in that country. On a global basis, however, the dietary health and sustainability INDICATOR would provide an aggregate INDICation of the sustainability of food production. 17.5 Decarbonizing energy systems"

Because of this it is known that in 2015 the world consumed 13.65 billion metric tonnes of oil equivalent, with energy demand having doubled over the previous 40 years. Of this energy, 81.4 per cent was provided by fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) emitting 32.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide (IEA 2017). feed-in tariffs"
GEO6_17_15,17,20,17.6.5 INDICATORs
GEO6_17_16,17,20,"No INDICATOR provides a single measure of progress towards a circular economy. However, there are several existing INDICATORs of performance in areas that directly or indirectly contribute to the achievement of a circular economic system. Sustainable resource management, societal behaviour, business operations, material flow accounting or analysis are among a number of measures that have been proposed (Geng et al. 2012; Wiedmann et al. 2015; United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2016). Taking into consideration linkages with the SDGs, we identify two policy-relevant INDICATORs of circularity."
GEO6_17_17,17,20,"INDICATOR 1: Domestic material consumption (DMC) (SDG INDICATORs 8.4.1, 8.4.2 and 12.2.2) Domestic material consumption measures the territorial consumption of primary materials used in the economy, whether these are domestically sourced or imported. This INDICATOR allows a comparison to be drawn between regions and states in per capita material consumption over time. DMC can also be used to estimate the amount of waste that may be generated in a given region. Domestic extraction (DE) is the amount of materials extracted in a given territory. DMC is higher than DE in net material importing countries and lower than DE in net material-exporting countries (Figure 17.7)."
GEO6_17_18,17,22,"INDICATOR 2: Societal behaviour (SDG INDICATORs 12.2.1 and 12.2.2) In addition, developing a circular economy will involve people changing their consumption behaviour and choosing products and services that conserve resources. Sharing resources, a common strategy in many subsistence economies, is being increasingly adopted around the world. Sharing of expensive or infrequently used products such as cars, bikes, holiday houses, camping and other recreation equipment may be organized as formal schemes or informal agreements within communities (Figure 17.8). 17.7 Conclusions"
GEO6_18_1,18,3,"Despite this comprehensive list, assessments of policy effectiveness both ex ante and ex post against a baseline are usually missing, even for well-designed policies. The analysis finds that policy evaluation tools are rarely used. An evidence base for measuring policy effectiveness is therefore lacking because it is difficult in many cases to attribute effects to environmental policies, and whether these effects would have taken place without the policies. Impact assessments and policy evaluations are not being applied in a systematic way. Therefore, while the analysis of INDICATORs, and the distance still to go to reach the goals, suggests that environmental policies are not yet sufficiently effective to achieve sustainable development, the analysis cannot reveal which policies and policy instruments are more effective or efficient than others."
GEO6_18_2,18,4,"The second track, bottom-up, was to identify policy-sensitive INDICATORs, meaning that one should be able to construct, again from the literature, a plausible story around why each INDICATOR appears to be improving in response to a policy or policy mix. Within Chapters 12-17, the subsections on INDICATORs therefore cover: their descriptions and their relation to SDGs or other"

Depending on the availability of data in the literature, these help to show: correlations between the adoption of certain policies by countries and improvements in the INDICATORs; trend analysis showing improvement in the INDICATOR; or the numbers of countries reporting on the INDICATOR over time."
GEO6_18_4,18,4,"The analysis above of policy effectiveness inevitably comes after a lag in time because policymakers do not know if a policy has been effective until some years after its initial implementation, especially if part of the INDICation of effectiveness is viewed to be implementation across multiple countries. This means that Part B has not been able to showcase new emerging, promising policy approaches, which are instead addressed in Chapter 24 (The Way Forward). Future editions of GEO will need to assess the eventual effectiveness of these policy approaches following their implementation. Policymakers have the opportunity meanwhile to examine the effectiveness criteria selected in GEO-6 and to use these when designing the new generation of policies and planning their evaluation."
GEO6_18_5,18,5,"Another gap in knowledge relates to the policy-sensitivity of INDICATORs. Among the hundreds of INDICATORs selected for the SDGs, which of these are policy-sensitive? Of the INDICATORs that are policy-sensitive, what are the corresponding policies that they are sensitive to? Which of these should governments be considering to achieve accelerated progress on the INDICATORs? Of the SDG targets that UN Environment is responsible for, which are policy-sensitive, and what should be the role of UN Environment in not only tracking these but also analysing policy effectiveness?"
GEO6_18_6,18,5,"Identify the INDICATORs that are policy-sensitive and can demonstrate causal links. Establish a clear linkage from the INDICATORs in the SDGs and other multilateral environmental agreements to known effective policies. The case studies showed the importance of multilateral agreements in the specific areas of air, biodiversity, oceans, land, fresh water (surface and groundwater), and in several cross-cutting areas. While such agreements are often unenforceable at the global level, they do carry moral suasion and provide peer pressure to embody the agreed approach in national and subnational policies, plans and programmes. Only weak links have been made so far between INDICATORs and effective policy, however, and additional work needs to be done in establishing these connections."
GEO6_18_7,18,5,"Conduct additional research on policy effectiveness. Researchers often finish their assessments with a call for more research, but in this case, it is justified. There are remarkably few well-documented case studies of policy effectiveness that follow the policy decisions throughout the policy cycle, from design to post-evaluation. The future work of UN Environment needs to strengthen the link between policies and environmental outcomes, particularly since the INDICATORs for SDGs are being monitored nationally and reported on globally. Further studies are needed on the political ecologies and stakeholder dynamics that underpin, drive or constrain the formation and movement of policies designed for environmental issues and sustainable development."
GEO6_19_1,19,5,"Building on previous assessments, particularly on GEO-5 (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2012), the focus of GEO-6 has shifted to a combination of the ‘what’ and ‘how’ questions, and the required approaches, to assess the state of scientific knowledge on the challenges and opportunities associated with global goals and targets. A universal, transformative and integrated agenda for sustainable development is now available in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (without it being explicit about this), to allow the goals of a broad range of multilateral frameworks and agreements to be brought together in a more coherent manner. Part C seeks to address the synergies (co-benefits) and trade-offs (competing aspects) in achieving the multiple goals and targets of these frameworks and agreements (e.g. SDGs, Nationally Determined Contributions, Aichi biodiversity targets), rather than analysing how to achieve their many individual INDICATORs separately. The guiding questions are: How can we achieve the environmental dimension of the"
GEO6_19_2,19,6,"Chapter 20 translates the mid- to long-term vision of the SDGs and a few related multilateral environmental agreements into a more concise and quantitative formulation of targets, focusing on the food-water-energy nexus. This includes extracting the available information from these frameworks and agreements, selecting some key environment-related priorities in relation to healthy planet, healthy people and identifying INDICATORs and quantitative target levels to track progress. Chapters 21 and 22 assess the model-based scenario literature (i.e. the top-down approach) to discuss current trends in Earth-human systems, and pathways towards achieving the long-term vision, respectively. No new scenarios were developed, and the analysis and assessment are based on existing scenarios (e.g. shared socioeconomic pathways). In Chapter 21, the scenario analysis focuses on current trends and identifies the potential implementation gaps between these and the targets identified in Chapter 20. Chapter 22, in contrast, identifies pathways that can achieve the selection of targets in a complementary and holistic way. Together, the three chapters provide a solutions-based perspective, including possible trade- offs and synergies for the identified pathways."

In such a scenario, long-term sustainability is incompatible with growing populations, which the literature INDICates will continue to grow at a global scale throughout this century. It is imperative in the present, therefore, to attend to how key population dynamics – including fertility rates, ageing populations, displacement and gender inequality – interact at multiple scales and impact environmental sustainability. Economic development: This refers to an increase in v human welfare, which depends on material consumption and many other factors, including the environment. While economic development has been highly correlated with economic growth in the modern era, the two are quite distinct, empirically as well as conceptually. Per capita consumption is expected to continue increasing in the foreseeable future (because of the unfinished agenda of eradicating poverty, meeting survival needs and enabling individuals to pursue prosperity). To decouple growth from negative environmental impacts, resource-efficient, sustainable patterns of consumption are needed. Technology: Technological change is well understood as a v driver of change, both negative and positive. Negatively, it provides an opportunity to accelerate, with incentives, the harnessing of natural resources for human ends; in times of crisis, incentives strongly favour adoption of riskier options and elimination or minimization of safeguards.

Other demographic variables remain on track. Urbanization: Having passed the symbolic 50 per cent v of population living in urban areas, trends INDICate that rural-to-urban migration will continue, with acceleration in the global south. This represents both an increased driver of environmental pressure and an opportunity to enhance"
GEO6_2_3,2,19,"Recent trends show that a significant dent has been made in the twin agendas of poverty eradication and reduction of global, between-country inequality. On the other hand, the manner and pace at which this has happened has given rise to day in 2011, using 2011 PPP $ This may INDICate that there has been a renewed urgency for reviving the growth momentum, not only in developing countries, but equally in developed ones too."
GEO6_2_4,2,23,"GEO-6 includes anthropogenic climate change as a driver of environmental change because it has acquired a momentum independent of future human activity; it is also analysed as a cross-cutting issue in Section 4.3.1 of this report. Figure 2.16 demonstrates the increase in CO concentration over the industrial period, charted on the same scale as the data for the transitions in CO concentration between the glacial and interglacial periods over the past 20,000 years. Other GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide have also been increasing consistently over the decades, as INDICated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s greenhouse gas INDEX and shown by Hartmann et al. (2013). The impact of such changes demonstrates that climate change is now a major driver of environmental change – an inexorable force that can no longer be ignored."
GEO6_2_5,2,26,"Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems (IPCC 2014). The risks are not only unevenly distributed but are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities. This is so in countries at all levels of development. The risk of climate- related impacts is a result of complex interactions between climate-related hazards and the vulnerability, exposure and adaptive capacity of human and natural systems. The rise in the rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts. Already, the annual global mean surface temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.07°C per decade since 1880 and at an average rate of 0.17°C per decade since 1970 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Figure 2.20: Multiple independent INDICATORs of a changing global [NOAA] 2015). The trends in sea surface temperature, marine air temperature, sea level, tropospheric temperature, ocean heat content and specific humidity are similar (IPCC 2014) (Figure 2.20). Beyond temperature increase, the impacts already observed include changes in the water cycle, warming of the oceans, shrinking of the Arctic ice cover, increase in the global mean sea level, and altering of the carbon and biogeochemical cycles (see more detail in Chapters 4 and 5). Further, there have been increases in the frequency and intensity of wildfires that in turn release GHGs. Observations and climate model simulations INDICate polar warming amplification resulting from various feedbacks in the climate system – the positive ice-albedo feedback being the strongest (Taylor et al. 2013). The reduced extent of ice cover reveals a darker surface, which leads to a decreased albedo, in turn resulting in a stronger absorption of solar radiation and a further acceleration of warming. In response to the increased warming in the Arctic, sea-ice extent is strongly decreasing, especially in summer (Vaughan et al. 2013). However, recent literature has concluded that temperature feedbacks play a dominant role, making surface albedo feedback the second main contributor to Arctic amplification (Pithan and Mauritsen 2014)."
GEO6_2_6,2,28,"One INDICation of the potential impacts is the doubling of the frequency of climate-related loss events (Figure 2.22) since 1980 (Hoeppe 2016). These events are already estimated to have resulted in the loss of 400,000 lives and the imposition of a cost of US$1.2 trillion annually on the global economy, wiping 1.6 per cent from global GDP."
GEO6_20_1,20,5,"The structure in Figure 20.1 loosely follows the five areas of critical importance mentioned in the preamble of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – people, prosperity and planet, underpinned by peace and partnership (United Nations 2015a). It also shows similarities with the doughnut model proposed by Raworth (2012; 2017); a doughnut-shaped area between two boundaries: a social floor (human well-being) and an environmental boundary (the natural resource base). The doughnut model highlights the dependence of human well-being on a healthy environment and stresses the need for improved equity in incomes and resource use, and greater efficiency in the latter (Raworth 2017). Finally, the structuring also relates to the triangle or pyramid originally proposed by Herman Daly, which moves from a base of ultimate means to a tip of ultimate ends, and integrates human well-being, economic development and the state of natural resources into a holistic framework (Daly 1973; Meadows 1998; Pinter et al. 2014). According to this framework, ultimate means refer to the underlying natural resource base and the life-support system of the planet (equivalent to the bottom circle in Figure 20.1, the natural resource base); intermediate means involve the material economy (middle circle, sustainable consumption and production); intermediate ends represent the capacities of individuals and the condition and functioning of institutions (top circle; human well-being); and ultimate ends INDICate human well-being or happiness (Pinter et al. 2014)."
GEO6_20_2,20,6,20.4 A long-term vision: selected targets and INDICATORs
GEO6_20_3,20,6,"A range of challenges exist when interpreting SDG targets and related INDICATORs with regard to their values. Assessing future developments and potential pathways for achieving all SDG targets is not possible because of limited data and time. Furthermore, such an analysis is limited by the scope of the existing scenario literature and the integrated assessment models that these studies are built on (see Chapter 21). A selection of targets should thus be made. Next to the challenge of selecting targets, many environment related SDG targets are broadly defined and/or phrased in non-quantitative terms (Lucas et al. 2016). In order to assess pathways towards achieving the environmental dimension of the SDGs, the selected targets need to be quantitative, requiring clear INDICATORs accompanied by target values."
GEO6_20_4,20,6,"For each target selected, one INDICATOR (and where relevant, two) is selected to track progress. In the context of the SDGs, the United Nations General Assembly adopted an SDG INDICATOR framework that consists of 232 INDICATORs (United Nations 2017). Each INDICATOR is being developed in order to provide accurate and reliable data from now until at least 2030. UNEP is the custodian agency for several SDG INDICATORs related to water (SDG 6), sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12), conservation and sustainable use of ocean resources (SDG 14) and of terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15) (United Nations 2018). In addition to being custodian agency for these SDG INDICATORs, UNEP is involved in most other SDG INDICATORs that have an environmental dimension. The selected INDICATORs link as much as possible to these globally agreed INDICATORs."
GEO6_20_5,20,6,"It should be noted that the selected INDICATORs are meant to track progress at the global level and that they are not always relevant at the national or subnational scale. Moreover, many INDICATORs, especially those related to sustainable consumption and production and the natural resource base, cover only part of what the goals and targets try to accomplish. For air quality in cities, for example, the proposed INDICATOR tracks progress for only one kind of air pollutant (i.e. fine particulate matter [PM] of diameter less than 2.5 µm and 10 µm; PM and PM ) – yet there are several others, with some interacting with each other (e.g. ozone, volatile organic compounds, sulphur dioxide etc.). With respect to health, only one INDICATOR was selected (the under-five mortality rate), which only partly reflects the interconnectedness of planet, society and human health that the SDGs, and GEO-6, are trying to represent. Focusing on a single INDICATOR to track progress for such targets should thus be done with care. To keep the analysis focused however, a limited set of targets is selected to cover, as much as possible, the food-water-energy nexus, while the selected INDICATORs are based mostly on the official SDG INDICATOR set."
GEO6_20_6,20,6,"Next to the INDICATOR and target levels presented in Tables 20.1, 20.2 and 20.3, additional INDICATORs are used in Chapters 21 and 22 to discuss future development of the respective targets, including relevant underlying developments, as well to discuss the potential of specific measures and important synergies and trade-offs across these measures and the selected targets."
GEO6_20_7,20,6,"Despite the centrality of human health to the GEO-6 theme of Healthy Planet, Healthy People, only one target (3.2) and one INDICATOR (3.2.1, under-five mortality rate) has been selected for the scenario analysis. Under-five mortality is generally seen as a good INDICATOR of quality of life, is influenced by numerous environmental determinants, is strongly related to other targets selected for human well-being. And the SDGs set a quantitative target for 2030. Scenario projections, although limited, also exist in the scientific literature that link future developments in under-five mortality to underlying environmental risk factors (see Section 21.3.6). The under-five mortality rate also has"
GEO6_20_8,20,7,Table 20.1: Selected targets and INDICATORs for human well-being
GEO6_20_9,20,7,"significant limitations, however. It excludes measures of morbidity, for example, including psychosocial aspects of childhood well-being (e.g. a sense of safety and of being loved) and other aspects of childhood health that may affect health and survival in later life (see Section 4.2.1). However, these latter data could not be gathered routinely and reliably worldwide, let alone for inclusion in a scenario context. Finally, by being age-limited, the under-five mortality rate does not account for other vulnerable populations, such as older people or pregnant women. As a result, child mortality only partly represents the effect on human health of the many and varied policies and measures, whether business-as-usual ones or transformative scenarios, that are discussed in the following chapters. SDG target 3.9 is more specific on particular environment- related health risk factors, targeting a substantial reduction in the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and from air, water and soil pollution and contamination. The specific INDICATORs associated with this target involve the mortality rate attributable to household and ambient air pollution, deaths due to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene and mortality from unintentional poisoning. These rates are largely a reflection of the pollution levels themselves. In effect, control of mortality implies control of pollution itself, which is the focus of several of the targets here, as well as that of several of the SDG targets selected for the natural resource base. And so, achievement of all of these targets is an essential part of the GEO-6 vision of Healthy Planet, Healthy People."
GEO6_20_10,20,8,"Several natural resource targets link explicitly or implicitly to specific MEAs that have more explicit quantitative targets and/or take a longer-term perspective, beyond 2030. For these targets, the target levels can be based on quantitative measures given by the agreements. SDG 13 on climate change includes only process- or activity-based targets, but explicitly refers to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the primary international intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. The target for climate change is thus based on the globally agreed target of the Paris Agreement: that is, “Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels” (UNFCCC 2015). The World Health Organization (WHO) established an air-quality guideline of 10 µg/m for annual mean PM concentrations (WHO 2006), but also defined interim targets of 15 μg/m , 25 μg/m and 35 μg/m . Here, we focus on the long-term effects of PM and use the percentage of the population exposed to annual mean PM concentrations above the highest interim target of 35 μg/m as the INDICATOR for achieving the target for air quality. For biodiversity loss, the SDG target does not include a target year for ending biodiversity loss. We derived the target from the Convention on Biological Diversity’s strategic plan for biodiversity 2011-2020, and more specifically Aichi biodiversity target five: “By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero…” (Convention on Biological Diversity 2010). This target was translated by Kok et al. (2018, p. 138) into halting “biodiversity loss by 2020 for developed countries and from 2030 onwards for developing countries”. Kok et al. (2018) use mean species abundance as a biodiversity-impact INDICATOR to track progress on this target (Alkemade et al. 2009). Mean species abundance is a measure of the intactness of an ecosystem relative to its undisturbed state. Specifically, it is the mean change in the abundance of the species that were present in the original, undisturbed state. Although it is different from the Living Planet INDEX (the SDG INDICATOR for target 15.5), it shares some important conceptual similarities."
GEO6_20_11,20,8,"For the selected targets for water scarcity, marine nutrient pollution, ocean resources and land degradation, no globally agreed or scientific quantitative target level is available. Therefore, for these targets no quantitative target level is set. The SDG INDICATOR for water scarcity is freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources (SDG INDICATOR 6.4.2). As this INDICATOR is only relevant at the local level, the total global population living in water scarce areas is used as an INDICATOR. For marine nutrient pollution, the SDG INDICATOR is an INDEX of Coastal Eutrophication (ICEP) and Floating Plastic Debris Density. The INDICATOR is still under development. Here, the focus is on coastal eutrophication, using nutrient runoff into oceans (N and P) as INDICATOR to track progress. For sustainable management of ocean resources, trends in the proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels, the SDG INDICATOR, are used to track progress. The SDG INDICATOR for land degradation is the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area, based on three sub-INDICATORs, namely trends in land cover, land productivity and carbon stocks (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification [UNCCD] 2017; van der Esch et al. 2017). Also this INDICATOR is still under development. Recognizing that all three sub-INDICATORs are important for assessing land degradation, trends in soil organic carbon stock are selected to track progress."

These SDG targets are mostly not quantitative – aiming to increase efficiency substantially without defining a specific target level. They address efforts or activities that help to achieve the endpoint targets. Their absolute level depends on specific overarching objectives.

The level of decoupling required thus depends on these endpoint targets. Therefore, for the selected SDG targets for sustainable consumption and production, no quantitative target levels are defined. Also not for SDG target 7.3, to “double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency”. Instead, the pathways analysis of Chapter 22 provides ranges for the efforts required to achieve the selected SDG targets that address human well- being and the natural resource base, taking into account the interdependencies across these efforts. and production"
GEO6_20_16,20,11,"The SDGs and related MEAs provide a long-term vision for sustainable development to influence policies at the global, regional, national and local levels. This chapter makes a selection of SDG targets, linked to targets from related MEAs and the scientific literature (science-based targets) where relevant, accompanied by clear INDICATORs and quantitative target values, at the global level. The resulting target set provides an integrated perspective on the environmental dimension of the SDGs, focusing on the GEO-6 environmental themes in Part A (air, biodiversity, oceans, land and fresh water) and related multidimensional poverty (access to food, water and energy, and under-five mortality). Unlike the SDGs and related MEAs, the science-based targets selected when there are no globally agreed quantitative targets - are not politically endorsed. They provide a proxy for the related SDG ambitions. Finally, for some selected targets no quantitative globally agreed or science-based target is currently available."
GEO6_21_1,21,5,"Not all relevant issues are addressed equally in the scenario literature. For instance, there are many scenarios published on climate change, while only a few scenario studies focus on water pollution. Other issues of global concern, such as chemicals and waste, are hardly addressed in the scenario literature (see Box 21.1). The available literature thus limits the scope of the analysis. As a result, not all relevant issues that are discussed in Part A of GEO-6, such as chemicals and waste, are covered in the analysis in Chapters 21 and 22. A widely used set of scenarios are the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs; see Box 21.2). The SSPs were developed principally to support climate research (van Vuuren et al. 2014; Riahi et al. 2017) but are also used extensively for other fields of environmental research and assessment. They explore a wide set of possible futures. Within the set, SSP2 is a scenario that represents medium developments for key drivers such as population, economic growth and technology development. Our assessment focuses on business-as-usual or trend scenarios, using the middle-of-the-road SSP2 scenario as a common thread across the different issues discussed. Other trend scenarios are used where relevant. Furthermore, SSP3 scenario results are shown where possible to INDICate the risk of higher population growth. assessments"
GEO6_21_2,21,8,"The economic projections also have implications for poverty. Historically, absolute poverty, as INDICated by the number of people living on less than US$1.90 a day, fell from 1.85 billion in 1990 to fewer than 800 million in 2013 (World Bank 2016a). Projections for 2030 range from 100 million to more than 1 billion, with most studies suggesting a level of 400 to 600 million people (Chandy, Ledlie and Penciakova 2013; Burt, Hughes and Milante 2014). The variation in the scenarios is due to the large differences in assumptions about growth in household consumption and changes in income distribution."

GEO6_21_7,21,10,"Studies published after Global Biodiversity Outlook-4 provide further consensus that biodiversity will continue to decline under business-as-usual scenarios. Model projections suggest changes in a number of different dimensions of biodiversity. The Global Land Outlook provides projections of Mean Species Abundance (MSA), a measure of the intactness of ecosystems, projecting a further increase of MSA loss: from 34 per cent in 2010 to 43 and 46 per cent in 2050, under SSP2 and SSP3, respectively (van der Esch et al. 2017; Figure 21.6). Using scenarios of land-use change consistent with the IPCC’s Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, Newbold et al. (2015) projected a fall of local species richness by 3.4 per cent by 2100 (see Figure 21.6). The combination of climate and land use change for the same RCP scenario is projected to lead to a cumulative loss of 38 per cent of species from vertebrate communities (Newbold 2018). Many of the effects are concentrated in biodiverse but economically disadvantaged countries (Newbold et al. 2015) and in tropical grasslands and savannahs (Newbold 2018).

Population sizes of mammalian carnivores and ungulates are also projected to decline under future land use and climate change (Visconti et al. 2016). Declines of 18-35 per cent by 2050 were projected in a LPI-like INDEX, base on species dispersal ability. These abundance declines are associated with an 8-23 per cent increase in the risk of extinction (Visconti et al. 2016)."

In some areas, the groundwater table may drop too deep, or the aquifer or river may run out of water, increasing concern for food security, energy, cities and ecosystems (Vanham et al. 2018). 21.3.5 Oceans"
GEO6_21_11,21,17,"Trends in ocean resources Protecting ocean resources (SDG target 14.4) is critical, as oceans are sources of food and nutrition for billions of people, especially in income-poor coastal zones where significant shares of nutrition and income derive from fisheries. In addition to being a direct source of human food, fish also contribute indirectly to human nutrition when used as fishmeal in aquaculture and livestock feed. Historically, fish demand per capita has risen significantly from 6kg/yr in 1950 to 20.3kg/yr in 2016 (FAO 2018), with other estimates spanning the range 18.8-21.4kg/yr in 2011 (Troell et al. 2014; Béné et al. 2015). At the same time, there has been a trend towards farmed fish. Since 2014, humans have consumed more farmed fish than wild fish (FAO 2016). Projections from FAO suggest that demand for fish will continue to grow in the future (FAO 2018). However, studies INDICate that a sustainable increase in wild fish catch will be difficult under current fishing strategies (Garcia, Rice and Charles 2016; FAO 2018). One important concern is that projections of marine primary productivity, which supports all marine fisheries, and ultimately all marine life, suggest a decline to 2100 under an RCP 8.5 scenario (Bopp et al. 2013; Fu, Randerson and Moore 2016), although considerable uncertainties remain (Laufkötter et al. 2015). No projections of the ‘proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels’ – the official SDG INDICATOR – are available in the literature. As a proxy, projections of global fisheries under an unchanged climate and current management scenario, suggest that, the proportion of fish stocks at or below a target biomass that can undergo recovery would increase from 53 per cent today to 88 per cent in 2050 (Costello et al. 2016). However, a wide range of improved management measures already in place. In most countries that are funding science and management adequately (Melnychuk et al. 2017), significantly improve the prospects for sustainability (Costello et al. 2016). Catch potential is projected to decline by an average of 7.7 per cent by 2050, while revenue might decline by 10.4 per cent over the same period (Lam et al. 2016)."
GEO6_21_12,21,17,"Environmental risk factors at household level have been declining since 1990, while risk factors at community and global level have been increasing. Global health risks have been shifting away from environmental risks and towards behavioural risks (e.g. smoking, childhood undernutrition, and alcohol use) and metabolic risks (e.g. high blood pressure, and high body mass INDEX) (WHO 2009; Forouzanfar et al. 2015). This shift in risk factors is part of a larger epidemiological transition, which has occurred globally over the past two centuries – mortality rates have been decreasing and shifting towards risks that affect people later in life (Murray et al. 2015)."
GEO6_21_13,21,17,"Trends in child mortality Under-five mortality is generally seen as a good INDICATOR of quality of life (see Section 20.4.1). Global child mortality (SDG target 3.2) declined dramatically from 91 deaths per thousand live births in 1990 to 43 per thousand live births in 2015, one of the most successful achievements of the Millennium Development Goal period (You et al. 2015). Yet more than 5 million children died in 2016 before reaching their fifth birthday, and 26 per cent of these deaths were due to environmental factors within our control (Prüss-Üstün et al. 2016). The five leading environmental risk factors (in order of health impact) are: household air pollution, unsafe drinking water, ambient particulate matter, unsafe sanitation, and insufficient handwashing (WHO 2009; Forouzanfar et al. 2015). Furthermore, malnutrition, including fetal growth restriction, child stunting and wasting, micronutrient deficiencies and suboptimal breastfeeding are important health risk factors, related to about 45 per cent of child deaths in 2011 (Black et al. 2013). In 1990, these five leading environmental factors accounted for nearly 2.8 million deaths in children under five (30 per cent of total under-five deaths), which decreased to just over 800,000 deaths in 2016 (24 per cent of total under-5 deaths). Currently, 79 countries have under-five mortality"
GEO6_21_14,21,18,"It should be noted that household, community and global environmental factors affect many human development INDICATORs beyond child mortality and, in turn, that child mortality is affected by many factors other than modifiable environmental factors. As INDICated above, the epidemiological transition implies a change in the balance of risks attributable to the environment, e.g. from water - related communicable diseases, to non-communicable diseases related to, for example, ambient air pollution. Success in dealing with the first of these will show far greater benefits for under-five mortality than success in dealing with the second. Furthermore, other environmental health risk factors affecting health in the under- fives – undernourishment for some, obesity for others – may show as increased risks to health and mortality in later life, rather than (or in addition to) mortality in the under-fives."
GEO6_21_15,21,20,"The results of the scenario assessment are summarized in Table 21.2 with reference to the selected SDG targets and INDICATORs (see Chapter 20). None of these targets is assessed to be achieved in the business-as-usual scenarios examined, but clear differences exist."
GEO6_22_1,22,8,"Dietary change Changes in diet are considered an effective measure for reducing land-use impacts of agriculture. Diet changes resulting in less meat consumption would reduce crop use as animal feed, which in turn would reduce demand for land, since direct human consumption of crops requires less land (Stehfest et al. 2009). In particular, a reduction in beef consumption would have the most direct positive impact on environmental INDICATORs, as ruminants have the lowest feed and protein conversion rates of all livestock (Béné et al. 2015). This implies that reduction of meat consumption to levels consistent with health recommendations in high-income countries could lead to positive impacts in terms of reducing agricultural land-use and increasing human health (Stehfest et al. 2009) – as on average current consumption of beef is above this level. Strong reductions in land area for food production as a result of dietary shifts towards more plant-based diets have been reported by Foley et al. (2011) and Stehfest et al. (2009). Such a shift would also lead to health benefits, according to these studies. Land-efficiency gains can also be gained by eating different meat. Meat from non-ruminant livestock (e.g. pigs) has a lower impact than beef, and the land footprint of their diets can be improved by shifting to more efficient (higher- yielding) fodder crops (Béné et al. 2015; van Zanten et al. 2018). Thus, diets based on lower shares of ruminants would reduce land demand. In the case of bivalves, aquaculture may even remove nutrient run-off into estuaries through filtration, a potential synergy."

While demand-side measures mostly reduce energy intensity, supply-side measures would increase the share of low-carbon options. These two INDICATORs can provide an insight into the challenge that such reductions would pose."
GEO6_22_3,22,21,"Alleviating poverty There is considerable overlap between poor health and poverty (Aber et al. 1997; Yoshikawa, Aber and Beardslee 2012). In fact, while poverty is generally INDICated as a measure of income, it can also be defined in terms of relative deprivation in a range of capabilities, including good health, but also higher levels of education (Hulme and Shepherd 2003; Alkire 2007). Poverty as defined by low income negatively impacts both health and education outcomes driving further deprivation (Hulme and Shepherd 2003). Conversely, eradicating extreme poverty (SDG target 1.1), and thereby improving the income situation of poor households, can improve health, especially of children under five. Women and girl’s education Inclusive and equitable quality education (SDG 4), especially of women, is highly correlated with reduced child mortality. Furthermore, higher levels of education are associated with better overall health, lower fertility rates, increased economic growth, reduced poverty levels and more democracy (Dickson, Hughes and Irfan 2010; Lutz and Samir 2013; Dickson, Irfan and Hughes 2016). Over half the decline in child mortality from 1970 to 2009 can be attributed to increased education of women of reproductive age (Gakidou et al. 2010). Lucas et al. (2018) show that through a comprehensive strategy that includes universal female education, piped drinking water, a complete phase-out of biomass use for cooking and advanced malaria control, 777,000 child deaths can be avoided in 2030, reducing the projected 2030 global child mortality rate by around 13 per cent. The largest health gains are projected for sub-Saharan Africa."
GEO6_22_4,22,22,"Earlier, we INDICated that technological changes, lifestyle changes and multi-scale approaches are available. The measures discussed in this chapter are part of such approaches. However, given the scale of the required transition it seems far more likely that these strategies will have to be combined to achieve the level of transformation that is needed. It can also be concluded that the approaches used to unlock the available potential presented by any of these approaches has, thus far, not been very successful. The existing MEAs have not led to any break with the past (Part A and Chapter 21). It is therefore important to ensure that there is sufficient interest among actors to implement a different set of strategies. This interest is, among other influences, related to the different trade-offs and synergies of the different measures."

Similarly, Climate CoLab proposals also emphasized the role of government, with national governments being referenced most. The importance of assessing diverse actors is elaborated further in Section 23.11.

Two of these – effective governance, and awareness and skills building – were highlighted as important interventions across all six Regional Assessments. The Regional Assessments INDICate the need to involve a diverse range of actors in seeking transformative solutions to achieve sustainable development, and all of the regional assessments emphasize the development of new collaborations between business, government and civil society. In addition to these commonalities, the assessments strongly reflected region-specific issues, which emphasizes the need for considering bottom-up initiatives. In North America, the identified governance and capacity-building needs focused on integrated forward-looking approaches that leveraged new technologies and citizen science in monitoring and reporting that would ultimately internalize environmental costs in the economy. Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean emphasized effective implementation and regulation to prevent further habitat loss and land degradation, focusing strongly on policies that strengthen equitable landownership and sustainable use of natural resources. Europe, and Asia and the Pacific strongly emphasized regional policy integration and cooperation, although the outlook for Europe focused its policy coordination around encouraging sustainable lifestyles,"

In West Asia, the dominant governance issue was peace and security. Only three assessments (Africa, Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean) emphasized the need for global governance in addressing tele-coupling aspects that transfer the impacts of production and consumption to other regions. This limited consideration of interregional impacts, particularly from major regions of consumption such as North America and parts of Asia and the Pacific, is concerning and should be included as an explicit criterion in future Regional Assessments. Monitoring and reporting, plastic and consumer waste reduction, and ecosystem restoration were also prevalent regional interventions that were not originally emphasized in the review of the scenario literature. Monitoring and reporting was emphasized by all regions except Europe, and the focus was on the use of new technologies and citizen science to monitor future trends and report on sustainable development. Plastic and consumer waste reduction was emphasized by most regions – except Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean – and focused primarily on solutions against landfill being used for solid waste management. Ecosystem restoration was emphasized by Europe, North America and West Asia, but the focus differed in each region. In North America, restoration was considered important for improved water-quality management, while in West Asia restoration was strongly focused on restoring coastal marine ecosystems as a strategy to reduce disaster risk. In Europe, restoration was an integrative pathway to realizing multiple goals for biodiversity conservation, the rewilding of abandoned farmlands, a reduction of nitrogen and GHG emissions, and the mental and physical health benefits of restoring blue-green infrastructure. Circular economies and smart cities for sustainability were highlighted as interventions by only some of the Regional Assessments (Figure 23.15) Nevertheless, at least two regions identified these as priority interventions, and there are INDICations from the bottom-up initiatives that these interventions represent emerging opportunities that can be leveraged as integrated and synergistic approaches to achieve sustainable futures. proposals addressing each intervention in the when they meet multiple measures) of seeds/proposals"

While protection of terrestrial ecosystems still dominates the interventions in this cluster, there are INDICations that conventional approaches are broadening in scope to include more integrated social-ecological initiatives, such as reduced food waste, yield improvement, agro-biodiversity, and forest and land management (Figure 23.16). In Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, this shift from a protection approach towards more sustainable land management has been reflected in the concept of ecological infrastructure and the complementary benefits it has for built infrastructure. In all regions, the lack of nutrition management and diet change, however, are notable gaps in the interventions highlighted by the Regional Assessments, INDICating that the more behavioural aspects of the social-ecological spectrum have not yet been fully entrenched into this cluster in the regions.

The first two of these are often bundled together, with the predominant narrative being around integrated water resource management to address water scarcity and water allocation issues. This was emphasized by Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and North America (the latter after recent droughts and under climate change projections). Interestingly, West Asia did not emphasize water scarcity in itself, but rather the investment costs of groundwater abstraction and desalination for continued water supply and sanitation of rapidly expanding cities. This INDICates that at least one region is explicitly emphasizing diversification of water sources as a feasible response to water supply challenges. Water quality issues – both in terms of safe wastewater treatment and water supply quality – were addressed separately from integrated water resource management. Water quality interventions were emphasized in the Outlooks presented for North America and West Asia, where both regions highlighted issues with wastewater treatment as well as chemical contaminants."
GEO6_23_6,23,32,"The analysis of the Climate CoLab proposals, where an overwhelming focus was put on solutions for the global South, particularly countries in Africa and Asia, highlights existing inequities in the perceptions of where interventions are necessary for transformation, and of who needs to act. While our analysis was of a small subset of studies, if it is INDICative of broader perceptions, the burden placed on the global South to transform and implement development initiatives or solutions exacerbates current power inequities in global governance structures (Nagendra 2018; Newell 2005; Parks and Roberts 2008; United Nations Research Institute for Social Development [UNRISD] 2016). This imbalance can obscure or ignore the role of the global North in current development trajectories (e.g. focusing only on poverty alleviation and not discussing wealth redistribution). While the GEO Regional Assessment for Europe did highlight trade-offs and tensions associated with tele-coupling, the limited emphasis on tele- couplings generally is of concern and requires concerted effort (tele-couplings highlight consumption patterns in one region driving environmental concerns related to production in another region) (Liu et al. 2013; Seaquist, Johansson and Nicholas 2014). Here, incorporating principles of distributive justice – normative principles designed to guide the allocation of the benefits and burdens of economic activity based on fair distribution (Lamont and Favor 2008) – can help to construct a development agenda based on principles of equity and equality. Such an equality-based and equity-focussed framework can help to account for the disparate developmental conditions of the global South and global North (Rosales 2008; Pelletier 2010; Nagendra et al. 2018). This process can provide more equitable options for where and how to implement the solutions with the most transformative potential to achieve sustainable development; for example, in reforming consumption and production patterns or in instituting market mechanisms such as caps in emission-trading schemes, carbon taxes and offsetting schemes. Addressing these global inequities is a means through which to achieve the global goal of equality."
GEO6_25_1,25,8,"There are on-going initiatives, such as the Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR)-Core data model framework as illustrated in Figure 25.6, to establish data and metadata standards to facilitate international collaboration and improve data standardization, interoperability, integration, accessibility, and dissemination of citizen science data (Bowser et al. 2017). Citizen science has the potential to provide credible data to bridge the data gaps highlighted in Chapter 3 and to provide data to enable the monitoring of SDG environmental INDICATORs."
GEO6_25_2,25,10,"Environmental assessments and evaluation Big data analytics enable illustrations of trends and progress over time (e.g. comparing current with historical data at a specific spatial site), reaches more end users beyond geographical boundaries, and allows a predictive analysis of the future using models and comparisons with historical data. Web-based and geospatial mapping technologies, remote sensing and statistical visualization provide a basis for analysis of environmental implications and raise issues on the scalability of data collected, as reflected in the sample of assessments and evaluations in Box 25.2. Big data from satellite imagery and sensors make the environmental INDICATORs measurable (Uitto 2016)."
GEO6_25_3,25,16,"As noted in Section 3.3.1, the data requirements for the SDG INDICATORs are almost as unprecedented as the SDGs themselves, and constitute a tremendous challenge to all countries. Unfortunately, much of the data required to monitor the SDGs are unavailable. Issues relating to quality, timeliness, human and financial capacity, and the lack of standardized methodologies all hamper our ability to comprehensively track this important agenda. As highlighted in the United Nations (2016) report on the SDGs, tracking their progress will require a shift in how data are collected, processed, analysed and disseminated, including a move to using data from new, diverse and innovative sources. More than ever, this demands that"

GEO6_3_2,3,4,"In the quest for achieving these ambitious goals, the SDGs are defined around 17 goals, 169 targets and 244 INDICATORs (inclusive of duplication) (United Nations 2017b). Transforming Our World… clearly notes that data requirements for the global INDICATORs present a tremendous challenge to all countries. One study estimated that an investment of US$ 1 billion per annum will be needed in order for lower-income countries to monitor the SDGs (Sustainable Development Solutions Network 2017). Thus, as highlighted in the 2016 SDG report, tracking progress on the SDGs will require a shift in how data are collected, processed, analysed and disseminated, including using data from new and innovative data sources (United Nations 2016b)."
GEO6_3_3,3,4,"Although the SDG framework creates monitoring challenges, it also creates opportunities. It represents the first time that there has been an attempt to holistically include environment- related INDICATORs in a global monitoring framework. Although the SDG framework has set out INDICATORs for measuring across all 17 SDG goals, many of the INDICATORs lack a statistical methodology. This is recognized in the framework by assigning each INDICATOR to one of three tiers (see Figure 3.2). The inclusion of a broad range of environment-related SDG INDICATORs can be used to leverage increased investment in environmental statistics and to promote their use."

GEO6_3_7,3,5,Figure 3.3: Environment-related SDG INDICATORs by goal
GEO6_3_8,3,5,"There are 93 SDG INDICATORs directly related to the environment (Figure 3.3). There are also a number of additional INDICATORs that are indirectly related to the environment (e.g. poverty, zoonotic disease, nutrition and life expectancy, economic growth, inclusive societies and policy processes which are not included in Figure 3.3). The environment-related SDG INDICATORs are spread across all of the SDGs, with at least one environmentally relevant SDG INDICATOR for each, except Goal 10 – which reflects the cross-cutting nature of the SDGs and the interactions between people, the environment and the economy. However, of the 93 environment-related SDG INDICATORs, only 34 currently have an existing agreed methodology and data that are available from most countries (Tier I). The other INDICATORs have either been given a Tier II or status (27 and 34 INDICATORs, respectively) by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG INDICATORs (Figure 3.4)."
GEO6_3_9,3,6,"In almost all thematic areas (including biodiversity, land, air, water and oceans), available data are lacking (Figure 3.4), particularly in developing countries. Environmental INDICATORs linked to industrial activities are easier to measure and monitor, for example energy consumption or water use. Land cover and ecosystem extent can be assessed on a broad scale using satellite remote sensing, but not always with the necessary resolution. The effects of environmental change, air and water pollution, and other environmental conditions are particularly difficult to measure (UNEP 2012); hence the need to explore a paradigm shift on environmental monitoring approaches – depicting the social orientation and complementing the approach with physical attributions."
GEO6_3_10,3,7,"Land (Chapter 8) Land is one of the most data-rich domains due to the effectiveness of earth observation in monitoring land surfaces, but there are still notable data gaps and quality issues. Earth observation generally measures the quantity rather than the quality of change, and is unable to measure certain processes. For example, there is agreement that land degradation has increased, but it is not done often and is inconsistently measured. The interrelationships between the Normalized Difference Vegetation INDEX (NDVI) and land degradation are often difficult to generalize and transfer, since land use and biophysical conditions are changing regionally. While forest cover data have improved since the mid-1990s and some broad- scale data are maintained by FAO, other data exist in multiple databases that are not always comparable. Soil erosion, salinization, desertification and change in ecosystem services are all difficult to measure from satellite images, and there are questions as to the appropriate scale of observation. There is no global database or standardized measurements of soil erosion, preventing a globally coherent or comprehensive assessment. Other difficult areas are land tenure and cadastral (map-based) information, since there is no global standard for defining land use, and systems are not comparable across countries."
GEO6_3_11,3,10,"The expectation that environmental assessments will include gender analysis and data is achieving mainstream acceptance. In 2016, UNEP produced the Global Gender and Environmental Outlook (GGEO) entirely through a gender lens. The GGEO report concluded that the effectiveness of environmental decision-making would be enhanced by “Strengthening the focus on developing, collecting and analysing gender- disaggregated data, INDICATORs and other information, including at the intra-household level.” (UNEP 2016, p. 201)."
GEO6_3_12,3,10,"The GGEO provides a summary of the most complete gender- disaggregated data sets available as of 2016. These include several gender-disaggregated agricultural INDICES (from FAO) on INDICATORs such as agricultural employment and landholders; cross-national comparative information on access to and ownership of land (from FAO, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] and the World Bank); and sex-disaggregated burden-of-disease data for a few environmental factors (Prüss-Ustün et. al. 2017)."
GEO6_3_13,3,10,"Additional large-scale efforts are under way to collect and analyse environment-related gender-disaggregated data: v in 2014, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) launched a project to identify gender and water priority INDICATORs (UNESCO 2014); v the FAO Gender and Land Rights Database “was launched in 2010 to highlight the major political, legal and cultural factors that influence the realisation of women’s land rights” (FAO 2018). By 2018, the FAO database had data from more than 80 countries, and the FAO ‘Legal Assessment Tool’ maps the intricacies of men’s and women’s access to land."
GEO6_3_14,3,10,"The prospects for improving gender-disaggregated environmental data are promising and the expectations for data collection for the SDGs should accelerate efforts to systematically collect both sex-disaggregated (INDICATORs specifically related to biologically rooted activities, roles and impacts), as well as gender-disaggregated (related to social roles and impacts) environmental data. There remains, however, a considerable gap between demand and supply. 3.6 Equity and human-environment interactions"
GEO6_3_15,3,11,"A number of SDGs depend for their realization on understanding and properly taking into account the costs and benefits of environment-economy relationships. Most importantly, the SDGs and natural capital accounting INDICATORs provide insight into the value of ‘nature’s contributions to people’, human societies more broadly, and of the cost of residuals such as pollution and waste. The economics of nature or natural capital accounting involve the assessment, measurement, aggregation and valuation of these contributions, to help policymakers ensure that this value is reflected in the economic activities of production, consumption, trade and investment through such instruments as pricing, costing and regulation. Evaluating the economic dimension of the environmental impacts of economic activities helps policymakers realize synergies between economic and environmental issues, gain efficiency in the allocation of limited resources and avoid trade-offs (or minimize them where they are inevitable). Any such evaluation should take into account that economic activities are increasingly characterized by global chains (e.g. investment, trade), and the role of such ‘teleconnections’ is crucial in determining overall impacts. Therefore, what we do to sustain environmental resources in one place may be at the expense of resources or environmental quality elsewhere. The System of Environmental Economic Accounts provides a framework for analysing the interactions between the environment and the economy. It includes information on four policy quadrants, namely: access to services and resources; managing environmental resources supply and demand; the state of the environment; and risks and extreme events (United Nations 2014)."
GEO6_3_16,3,12,"conditions and health and well-being can also reveal underlying relationships between health and the environment. For example, data on underweight children, malnutrition and other food security INDICATORs can be analysed through an environmental lens to better understand the relationship between climate change and food security, health and well-being."
GEO6_3_17,3,13,"The SDG INDICATOR framework While the SDG agenda is bold and ambitious, it is not possible to cover everything at the same time. Therefore, the ability to prioritize and sequence is strategic for success in the delivery of measurement to the global agenda. So, which data, which statistics and which INDICATORs?"
GEO6_3_18,3,13,"With regard to INDICATORs, official statisticians, under the guidance of the UNSC, have worked hard to identify an INDICATOR framework and the feasibility of INDICATORs that would feed into the framework. However, the design of the framework has, in practice, been directed towards the number of INDICATORs, rather than to an architecture that would determine the INDICATORs. The existence of the framework and the ability to identify INDICATORs feeding into the framework is a commendable start."
GEO6_3_19,3,13,"As defined in Section 3.1, less than a quarter of the environment-related SDG INDICATORs are Tier I. This gives some idea of the difficulty of measurement, including resourcing of the statistics systems, in some countries."
GEO6_3_20,3,14,"Underlying challenges Major data gaps, across the globe and across environmental domains, limit our ability to identify trends and manage unwanted outcomes. In many countries, official statistics on the environment are rarely generated, are difficult to access, are scattered across different institutions, and reporting is fragmented (UNEP 2016). Across many environmental topics, data availability is geographically unbalanced, being scarcer for rural areas and developing countries. Monitoring systems from global to regional scales are fragmented, lack coverage and are often not updated on a regular basis (UNEP 2012, p. 129). There is a pressing need to create regular monitoring that follows commonly agreed international standards that are best enacted through international cooperation. There is also a need for increased sharing of data in a standardized format, for example, data that is compliant with Statistical Data and Metadata e-change standards. The United Nations SDG report of 2016 explains that data requirements for the global INDICATORs are almost as unprecedented as the SDGs themselves, and constitute a challenge for many countries. Tracking progress on the SDGs would require the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of an unprecedented amount of data and statistics at the subnational, national, regional and global levels, including those derived from official statistical systems, as well as from new and innovative data sources (United Nations 2016b)."
GEO6_3_21,3,14,"Environmental monitoring and forecasting systems have been growing rapidly. However, combining information from multiple systems to generate statistics and INDICATORs remains a major challenge. Earth observation is defined by the global Group on Earth Observations as both surface observations (in situ) and those collected by aircraft and remote sensing, including from satellites and other space missions. Similarly, a data set collected for one purpose can often be used for multiple purposes. For example, agricultural land cover could be useful for understanding natural disaster risk, examining the migration of people, the nature of informal settlements, urban infrastructure and their relationship with biodiversity and ecosystems. Earth observations and environmental monitoring are being transformed through integration of administrative data from national statistical agencies, including economic data, and open data policies for Earth observations that benefit both emerging economies and developed countries. Open Earth observations, citizen science, social media, and digital platform or big data access can stimulate a transformation to a new model for creating data which results in more inclusive, social, robust knowledge for decision-making, where there is broader understanding and access to policy-relevant knowledge."
GEO6_3_22,3,14,"For example, the first Atlas of the Human Planet (Pesaresi et al. 2017), derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), provides a validated source of information on human habitations, from villages to megacities. The baseline data, spatial metrics and INDICATORs related to population and settlements, developed in the frame of the Group on Earth Observations Human Planet initiative, provide users with a baseline data platform for monitoring and analysis. The GHSL resource is an example of the potential of public data to support global, national and local analyses of human settlements and, in particular, support policy and decision-making. This application of Earth observations is essential for evidence-based modelling of human and physical exposure to environmental contamination and degradation, as monitored through multilateral environmental agreements; disasters as encompassed by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; the impact of human activities on ecosystems, as measured by the Convention on Biological Diversity; and human access to resources, assessed by the SDGs (European Commission 2018)."
GEO6_3_23,3,14,"Within the United Nations system, agencies including the UNSC InterAgency Expert Working Group (IAEG-SDG) and the United Nations custodial agencies taking a lead in developing monitoring methodologies are examining, and in some cases preparing to incorporate, Earth observation and geospatial data for support of the SDGs, its targets and INDICATORs. A 2016 analysis by the Group on Earth Observations estimated that at least 98 targets and INDICATORs could benefit from and use Box 3.5: Article 76 of the 2030 Agenda"
GEO6_4_1,4,7,"Other evidence suggests that when women are accorded equal voice in environmental decision-making, public resources are more likely to be directed towards human development priorities and investments (Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004; UN- Women 2014). Women’s enhanced access to and control over productive agricultural resources helps create food security and sustainable livelihoods (FAO 2011; UN-Women 2014). The use of gender budgeting is another important approach to promote gender-responsive financing. The SDG framework reveals that sustainable development will not evolve, nor will environmental policies and initiatives be effective, if gender equality and women’s empowerment are not enhanced (United Nations 2015a). Environmental sustainability and justice contribute significantly to SDG 5: achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, and to the gender targets of SDGs 1, 4, 8 and 10 (Agarwal 2010; UNEP et al. 2013; Agarwal 2015; United Nations 2015b; Dankelman 2016; UNEP 2016a). While gender equality can be tacitly read in all the other SDG goals, there are almost no explicit gender targets and INDICATORs included in the environment-related SDGs."
GEO6_4_2,4,9,"During the United Nations Decade for Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014) (DESD) significant progress was made around the world with implementing ESD in all educational sectors (e.g. McKeown 2015; Watson 2015). Monitoring and evaluation of the DESD has shown many good examples of integrating ESD in curricula. Reviews of official curriculum documents show that “many countries now include sustainability and/or environmental themes as one of the general goals of education” (UNESCO 2014, p. 30). Most progress has been made in developing curricula towards ESD in primary and secondary education. “Close to 40% of Member States INDICate that their greatest achievement over the DESD has been the integration of ESD into formal curricula, with another fifth describing specific school projects as being their most important contributions to ESD” (UNESCO 2014, p. 82). There has also been good progress with the implementation of ESD in higher education (Karatzoglou 2013; Lozano et al. 2015). This is particularly the case in Europe, where there has been a stronger interest in the integration of sustainable development in higher education institutions than in other parts of the world (Lozano et al. 2015; Barth and Rieckmann 2016)."
GEO6_4_3,4,13,"More than 70 per cent of the planet’s fresh water is locked up in ice in the polar regions. If released, the water stored in the Greenland Ice Sheet would result in a 7.4 metre rise in sea level, the water in the Antarctic Ice Sheet would result in a 58.3 metre rise, and the water stored in all mountain glaciers would yield a 0.4 metre rise (Vaughan et al. 2013). In a scenario limiting temperature increase to below 2°C, the world would still see a mean rise of global sea levels by 0.4 to 0.6 metres. A business-as-usual scenario produces an average sea level rise of 0.7 to 1.2 metres by the end of the 21st century (Horton et al. 2014). As the latest IPCC report and multiple independent scientific studies INDICate, mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets are already losing mass and are contributing on average the equivalent of 1.85 mm of sea level rise per year (Bamber et al. 2018)."
GEO6_4_4,4,15,"Pharmaceuticals are commonly mishandled ‘from cradle to grave’ with over 200 different substances reported in river waters globally (Petrie, Barden and Kasprzyk-Hordern 2015). Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have evolved and spread due to mismanagement of antibacterial drugs (Marti, Variatza and Balcazar 2014; Grenni, Ancona and Caracciolo 2017). Recent research INDICates that the development of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens is accelerated and achieved at lower exposure concentrations, in the presence of heavy metals and other contaminants that are commonly found in the same contaminated reservoirs (The Lancet Planetary Health 2018). The presence of such contaminants in the natural environment results from the discharge of wastewater from treatment plants that are unequipped to effectively remove these dangerous compounds (Petrie, Barden and Kasprzyk-Hordern 2015) and from mismanagement of their use for agricultural production, particularly in livestock (Hamscher and Bachour 2018)."
GEO6_4_5,4,15,"Nanotechnology, by decreasing the particle size of materials and increasing its reactivity, may give a material some interesting properties, but these may be toxic (Schulte et al. 2016). There remain a number of questions about the toxicity of nanoparticles to humans and the environment, but comparison of nanomaterials of certain size and shape with asbestos INDICates similar toxicological potential (Nagai and Toyokuni 2012; Allegri et al. 2016)."
GEO6_4_6,4,19,"An important issue arising from resource use is that the environmental and social costs are typically greatest during extraction when land is cleared, or populations displaced, while the greatest benefits accrue at the other end of the supply chain. To fully appreciate the cost-benefit ratio and the actual value of a product, it is important to consider the environmental consequences of global trade in resources, including the repercussions for local communities in areas of resource extraction. Interest is growing in tracing the origins and added values of supplied resources through sustainable supply chain management. This traceability supports action on issues such as conflict minerals, chemical and pharmaceutical waste, food contamination and illegal trade in endangered species (Mundy and Sant 2015; Paunescu, Stark and Grass 2016; Tijani et al. 2016; Sauer and Seuring 2017). The availability and distribution of this type of information defines a connection between supplier and consumer and encourages more sustainable resource use choices. Recent research INDICates, however, that humanity has overshot the safe operating space for certain planetary systems, specifically climate change, the rate of biodiversity loss and the biogeochemical flow of the nitrogen cycle (Rockström et al. 2009; Steffen et al. 2015). Some updated analyses would add phosphorus to that overshoot list (Carpenter and Bennett 2011; Cordell and Neset 2014)."
GEO6_4_7,4,19,"By 2015, global energy consumption reached around 13.5 billion tons of oil equivalent (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2018). That is expected to increase to around 19 billion tons by 2040 (IEA 2016). Much of this increase is attributed to consumption expected in developing economies that currently depend largely on fossil-based energy sources. This makes accelerated efficiency a crucial strategy to mitigate energy-related impacts. At the same time, nearly 1.2 billion people remain without access to electricity and 2.7 billion still resort to traditional fuels for cooking and heat, facing exposure to concentrated indoor air pollution (IEA 2016). Improved access to modern energy services is not only closely connected to all Sustainable Development Goals and INDICATORs, including food security, health and quality education, but shifting to clean and efficient forms of energy also empowers women and other marginalised groups responsible for the collection and burning of primitive solid fuels (World Energy Council 2016)."
GEO6_4_8,4,20,"At the global scale, greenhouse gas emissions amounted to 33 gigatons of CO equivalent in 2014 and may reach 38 gigatons in 2040, due mostly to the burning of fossil fuels (IEA 2015). Historical data demonstrate trends in decoupling through decarbonization and improved efficiency, but the current trend still INDICates a global temperature increase beyond the 2°C threshold target of the Paris Agreement (Figure 4.11) (IEA 2015; United Nations 2015b; IEA 2016). This likely overshoot warrants bolder action. The economics of transition to low-carbon energy sources have been greatly assisted by a dramatic reduction in the cost of renewables, especially wind and solar photovoltaic systems. Solar photovoltaic systems experienced a price decline of 23 per cent for each cumulative doubling of production over the last 35 years. In many cases these costs are now lower than those of conventional fossil fuel electricity generation technologies (International Renewable Energy Agency [IRENA] 2015). Further reductions are expected making them possibly the best economic-environmental option in practically every country in the world before 2025 (Figure 4.12)."
GEO6_5_1,5,7,"There are considerable gaps in available emissions data for POPs, which include pesticides, industrial chemicals and products of incomplete combustion or chemical reactions. Available data in Europe, America and Central Asia INDICate that emissions decreased significantly between 1990 and 2012 for the most studied POPs, due to regulations, including the Stockholm Convention (UNEP 2014a; UNEP 2014b; UNEP 2015a; UNEP 2015b). Nevertheless, alongside the growing number of listed POPs and candidate substances, unregulated POPs emissions may be increasing. Many commercial products contain unknown quantities and types of unregulated POPs, often with unknown effects (see also Section 4.3.3)."
GEO6_5_2,5,17,"Perennial ground-based in situ observations of ODS show a clear decline since the implementation of the Montreal Protocol (Newman et al. 2007; Engel et al. 2018). However, the decreasing trend slowed down by about 50 per cent after 2012 for trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) (Montzka et al. 2018). There are INDICATORs that the stratospheric O layer is starting to recover. Total atmospheric column O declined over most of the globe during the 1980s and early 1990s, but has remained stable since 2000, and there are INDICations of an increase in global-mean total column O over 2000-2013 (Figure 5.13) (WMO 2014). Since around 2000, measured concentrations of O in the upper stratosphere show an increasing trend, and modelling results INDICate that decreasing ODSs and increasing GHGs, which increases stratospheric ozone by cooling the stratosphere, contributed equally to the increase in upper stratospheric ozone (WMO 2014; Harris et al. 2015; Chipperfield et al. 2017). Over Antarctica, positive trends for 2001-2013 were found for O concentrations in the lower stratosphere (about 10-20 km) for austral summer and for total column O for spring and summer (Kuttippurath and Nair 2017; Solomon et al. 2017). For the mid-latitudes (60°S and 60°N), there is no"

As ODS concentrations continue to decline throughout the 21st century, stratospheric O concentrations are expected to rise, though the trends will be increasingly dominated by effects from rising GHG concentrations; thus, the time frame for stratospheric O to recover to 1960 levels is uncertain (Chipperfield et al. 2017)."
GEO6_5_4,5,18,"replacements, HCFCs and HFCs, which are potent GHGs, have been increasing exponentially since 2005, though these remain low overall and currently contribute to less than 4 per cent combined of the radiative forcing due to all GHGs. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Annual Greenhouse Gas INDEX (AGGI), radiative forcing by long-lived GHGs increased by 78 per cent between 1979 and 2016, with CO accounting for about 72 per cent of this increase."
GEO6_5_5,5,18,"Climate change can also impact atmospheric circulations and features at global and regional levels. Observations INDICate a widening of the tropical belt, a poleward shift of storm tracks and jet streams, and a contraction of the northern polar vortex since the 1970s are likely (Hartmann et al. 2013). Stratospheric O depletion and GHG warming may have contributed to the poleward shift of the southern Hadley cell and positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, which characterizes the north-south movement of the belt of westerly winds that circles Antarctica, during the austral summer (Bindoff et al. 2013). Attribution of anthropogenic influence on the poleward shift of the Hadley cell in the Northern Hemisphere is less certain (Bindoff et al. 2013). While many studies have INDICated changes in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and monsoon circulations, there are large observational and modelling uncertainties such that there is low confidence that changes, if observed, can be attributed to anthropogenic activities (Bindoff et al. 2013). There is increasing evidence that climate change has led to changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events since the mid-20th century (Trenberth 2011; Hartmann et al. 2013; Alexander 2016). It is likely that the frequency of extreme warm days has increased in North America, Central America, Europe, Southern Africa, Asia and Australia, and the frequency of heat waves has increased in Europe, Australia and across large parts of Asia (Hartmann et al. 2013). Observations have shown a general increase in heavy precipitation at the global scale that the frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation events has increased in North America, Central America and Europe, and it is virtually certain that there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic basin since the 1970s (Hartmann et al. 2013). For drought, the frequency and intensity likely have increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa, and likely have decreased in central North America and north-west Australia (Hartmann et al. 2013)."
GEO6_5_6,5,19,"Air Pollution Exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution was responsible for 6 million (Global Burden of Disease [GBD] Risk Factor Collaborators 2017) to 7 million (WHO 2018) premature deaths in 2016. The GBD Study estimated that long-term exposure to ambient PM was responsible for between 3.6 and 4.6 millions of those premature deaths and between 95 and 118 million years of healthy life lost from heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease and respiratory infections (Cohen et al. 2017; GBD Risk Factor Collaborators 2017; HEI 2018). Consequently, exposure to ambient PM is the highest environmental risk factor for the global burden of disease and sixth among all risk factors in terms of disability-adjusted life years lost, behind high blood pressure, smoking, low birth weight, high levels of blood sugar and high body mass INDEX (GBD Cancer Collaboration 2017). The estimates of premature deaths underestimate the total number of individuals affected, because air pollution has potential effects on everyone who breathes the air, rather than being the sole reason for early death in a small subset of the population (Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants [COMEAP] 2010). Even brief periods (minutes to hours) of exposure to high concentrations of pollutants can have significant health impacts (WHO 2006), and episodes of unusually high air pollution attract public concern (e.g. Vidal 2016; Safi 2017). However, the greatest damage to public health is associated with long-term exposure – living in areas of high annual average exposure (HEI 2017). Importantly, there is no known safe level of annual average PM exposure About 43 per cent of the world’s population, primarily in low- income countries, uses biomass for heating and cooking. The resulting indoor and outdoor air pollution contributes to acute lower respiratory infections (ALRTI) and pneumonia among children, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer among adults (WHO 2007; Sumpter and Chandramohan 2013; WHO 2018). The GBD Study attributed between 66 and 88 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost, and between 2.2 and 3.0 million premature deaths in 2016 to household air pollution (GBD Risk Factor Collaborators 2017), whereas WHO estimated the burden to be approximately 3.8 million premature deaths (WHO 2018)."

GEO6_5_8,5,21,"In recent decades, most countries with predominantly fair- skinned populations have experienced a steady increase in the incidence rates of CMM which is responsible for about 80 per cent of the deaths due to skin cancer (Lucas et al. 2015). Excessive exposure to UV radiation accounts for 60-90 per cent of the risk for CMM (Olsen, Carroll and Whiteman 2010; WHO 2004). Increasing incidence rates of CMM and other UV-related adverse health impacts are unlikely to be due to changes in UV exposure due to stratospheric O depletion, but rather to increases in risky sun exposure behaviour (Lucas et al. 2015). However, without the Montreal Protocol, incidence of skin cancer may have been 14 per cent greater, affecting 2 million INDICated by the column due to (a) emissions produced by the row Climate change Over the coming decades to centuries, adverse health effects from climate change are forecast to greatly exceed any potential health benefits (Smith et al. 2014; Watts et al. 2017). The effects of climate change on human health can be classified as direct (e.g. heat waves, storms), less direct (e.g. changes in disease-vector ecology, reductions in water supply, or exacerbation of air pollution episodes) and diffuse (Butler 2014; Melillo, Richmond and Yohe 2014). The category of diffuse effects could have the largest burden of disease through means such as conflict (Kelley et al. 2015), migration (Piguet, Pecoud and de Guchteneire eds. 2011) and famine. Mental health effects arise from all three categories (e.g. post- traumatic stress disorder). The health impacts of a changing climate will be inequitably distributed globally. Climate change and increasing climate variability “worsen existing poverty, exacerbate inequalities, and trigger both new vulnerabilities and some opportunities for individuals and communities” (IPCC 2014, p. 796)."
GEO6_6_1,6,8,"Urban growth is a major driver of land-use change and habitat loss through deforestation. In developing countries, the establishment and expansion of urban areas (many of which lack adequate planning) and the growth of infrastructure can coincide with biodiversity hotspots (UNEP 2016d). Road construction facilitates the spread of invasive species, and allows for easier access into previously intact habitats, exposing them to threats from hunting and resource exploitation (Alamgir et al. 2017). Additional land-use practices, such as burning (or the suppression of natural fire) (Smith et al. 2016) and livestock grazing, impose further pressures on already degraded systems (Royal Botanic Gardens Kew2010). The marine environment is equally affected and heavily impacted by commercial fishing practices, such as bottom trawling, coastal development and dredging (Ocean Health INDEX 2017) (see Chapter 7). International trade can export threats to biodiversity, resulting from demand in developed countries, to developing countries (Lenzen et al. 2012). Many of the causes of habitat destruction also contribute to human population pressure and movement, which further compound and vulnerable) and near threatened Percent Pressure from agricultural land use is widely expected to increase (Kehoe et al. 2017). Global food production is forecast to rise by between 60 and 100 per cent by 2050 as a result of population growth and economic development, with an accompanying minimum net increase in land under crop production of 70 million ha (Tilman et al. 2011; Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012) (see Chapter 8). Large-scale industrial agriculture has many unfavourable environmental and social effects, such as land degradation, albedo changes, increase in methane emissions and loss of carbon sequestration capacities (Laurance, Sayer and Cassman2014; Dangal et al. 2017; Houspanossian et al. 2017). Agricultural intensification can reduce pressure on non-agricultural lands (Phalan et al. 2016), but may have detrimental impacts on wild plant and animal species that cohabit within diverse agroecosystems (Emmerson et al. 2016)."

The active engagement of indigenous and local communities in the decision-making process has proven highly effective at addressing these imbalances (see Box 6.10). Analysis of deforestation rates INDICate that these can be significantly lower in community- managed forests in comparison to strictly protected areas (Porter-Bolland et al. 2012). The development of a more inclusive and integrated approach linking communities with national, divisional and provincial governments for sustainable development has proved highly efficient (see Locally Managed Marine Areas case study in Fiji in Section 13.2.1).

GEO6_6_14,6,27,"Our understanding of the natural world and the threats posed to its integrity has never been greater. New technologies have allowed us unparalleled insight into the different dimensions of biodiversity, from genomes to biomes. The major pressures on biodiversity are increasingly well-understood – habitat transformation/land-use change, invasive species, pollution, overexploitation including the illegal wildlife trade and climate change – though each of the world’s biomes faces distinct challenges, reflecting particular geographic, ecological and socioeconomic contexts. Biodiversity loss is exacerbated where there is significant inequality in wealth and is a major threat to intergenerational justice. But the political and social will necessary to preserve biological diversity has been lacking. While certain policy responses have demonstrated effectiveness in promoting biodiversity conservation, persistent negative trends in almost every aspect of biodiversity INDICate the need for more concerted action. Wildlife populations are thinning, reducing their adaptive potential; current rates of species extinctions are estimated to be orders of magnitude greater than background rates, with some scientists suggesting that we may be entering a sixth mass extinction event, and ecosystems are becoming increasingly degraded."
GEO6_7_1,7,7,"The severity of bleaching varies both within reefs and between regions, and some areas that have not previously experienced bleaching have been impacted in this latest event. A recent initiative to identify the 50 reef areas most likely to survive beyond the year 2050 has been announced, with the goal of encouraging governments to set these areas aside for protection and conservation (https://50reefs.org). The recently published summary of IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, O’Neill et al. (2017) concluded that there “is robust evidence (from recent coral bleaching) of early warning signals that a biophysical regime shift already may be underway”. Veron et al. (2009) predicted the coral reef bleaching tipping point (an abrupt change in state that occurs when a threshold value is exceeded) would occur once global atmospheric CO reached 350 ppm. This value was reached in about 1988, but because ocean warming lags behind global atmospheric CO levels (Hansen et al. 2005) it has taken almost 30 years for the impact of this level of CO to be revealed. The lag effect is due to the slow rate of global ocean circulation compared with the rapid rate of rising CO levels. In effect, the ocean is currently responding to CO levels of decades ago and the balance of evidence INDICates that a tipping point for coral bleaching has now been passed (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007; Frieler et al. 2013). The Veron et al. (2009) 350 ppm tipping point, reached 29 years ago, may have been the death sentence for many corals. And given that global atmospheric CO levels are now in excess of 400 ppm, there are serious implications for the very survival of coral reefs. Recent modelling suggests more than 75 per cent of reefs will experience annual severe bleaching before 2070, even if pledges made following the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference (COP 21) become reality (van Hooidonk et al. 2016; UNEP 2017). Experts agree that the coral reefs that survive to the end of the 21 century will bear little resemblance to those we are familiar with today (Hughes et al. 2017). the 2014-17 (still ongoing at the time of writing) period of coral bleaching alert area June 2014 - May 2017 Warning Alert Level 1 Alert Level 2"

In addition, interactions of environmental change and stock dynamics in the face of inertia in management decisions played central roles in the collapse of the cod fisheries in eastern Canada (Rose 2007; Rice 2018), and fisheries for Pacific small pelagic species off Peru and Chile (Chavez et al. 2008). The large volume of literature on fisheries sustainability contains many cases of both unsustainable expansion, and successes in managing exploitation rates and rebuilding previously depleted stocks. For countries where capacity and political will exist to assess stock status and fishing mortality, and implement monitoring, control and surveillance measures, trends from 1990 to the present INDICate that overfishing is usually avoided (Hilborn and Ovando 2014; Melnychuk et al. 2016). However, the reviews also show wide variation among countries, with factors such as overall wealth to invest in fisheries research and management while avoiding capacity-enhancing subsidies, strongly affecting the ability to keep fisheries sustainable. In the large majority of cases where jurisdictions have resources for sufficient research and management, and have implemented effective governance, fishing mortality has been constrained or reduced to sustainable rates, and stocks are assessed as either healthy or recovering from historical overfishing (Figure 7.4). However, where significant funding for resource assessments and monitoring, control and surveillance measures are not made available, overfishing, illegal, unreported or unregulated (IUU) fishing and resource depletion continue and may be expanding.

Aichi Target 10 is related to coral reefs conservation: “By 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs, and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted by climate change or ocean acidification are minimized, so as to maintain their integrity and functioning.” The oceans SDG target 14.2 – “by 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans” – may not be attainable for most tropical coral reef ecosystems.

GEO6_8_1,8,14,"in more developed countries, are showing an increase in forest cover, though some of this forest is as plantations. Natural forests continue to decline in most areas of the world (Figure 8.15), threatening the supply of essential benefits to people. For example, as deforestation increases in the Amazon rainforest, rainfall has been decreasing. Recent estimates INDICate that a critical tipping point for the hydrological cycle in this part of South America will be reached if deforestation reaches 20-25 per cent of the original forest cover in the Amazon basin (Lovejoy and Nobre 2018). In the last 50 years, 17 per cent of the original extent of the Amazon rainforest has been deforested (World Wide Fund for Nature [WWF] 2018) and the forest cover continues to decrease (Butler 2017; WRI 2018; WWF 2018). Urban expansion Built-up areas occupy a very small fraction of land. However, since 1975 urban clusters (i.e. urban centers as well as surrounding suburbs ) have expanded approximately 2.5 times, accounting for 7.6 per cent of global land area (Paresi et al. 2016). Between 1975 and 2015, built-up areas doubled in size in Europe, while in Africa they grew approximately fourfold. Cities have grown in both regions, but urban population remained relatively constant in Europe while it tripled in Africa. This means that the built-up area per-capita is different across the world (Paresi et al. 2016). In addition, urban expansion leads to landscape fragmentation and urban sprawl. As cities expand, urban land uses usually take over agricultural lands (van Vliet, Eitelberg and Verburg 2017), and the demand for food, fibre and minerals can transform previously unconnected locations (Seto et al. 2012; van Vliet, Eitelberg and Verburg 2017). In Latin America, a pervasive spatial expansion (almost 84 per cent of the population lives in cities) has been observed leading to less compactness (Inostroza, Baur and Csaplovics 2013)."
GEO6_8_2,8,15,"Recent research (Global Assessment of Soil Degradation [GLASOD]) shows that previous generalizations claiming that land degradation is occurring in semiarid areas worldwide is not supported by satellite-based observations (de Jong et al. 2011; Fensholt et al. 2012; Cherlet et al. 2018). Desertification and drought research in the Sahel INDICate that the first process is not taking place (Behnke and Mortimore 2016). This trend may be explained by increasing precipitation, as well as by lower pressure on land due to outmigration (Olsson, Eklundh and Ardö 2005). However, current climatic conditions in the Sahel appear to be still below the more humid conditions of 1930-1965 (Anyamba and Tucker 2005; Nicholson 2013). A positive trend is also observed in semi-arid areas of China where human actions might explain the ‘expansion of desertification’ between 1980 to 1990, although conservation activities have begun to reverse these trends (1990-2000) (Xu et al. 2009). Recent modelling results INDICate that global greening might also be caused by CO fertilization, nitrogen deposition and climate change (Zhu et al. 2016)."
GEO6_8_3,8,15,"Soil salinization In arid and semi-arid regions, lack of adequate drainage in irrigated areas triggers salt accumulation in the root zone, negatively affecting crop productivity and soil properties (Qadir et al. 2014). In some countries, soil salinization affects half of irrigated land (Metternicht and Zinck 2003). Other sources suggest that about 33 per cent of the globally irrigated area has declining productivity due to inadequate irrigation, causing waterlogging and salinization (Khan and Hanjra 2008). Several studies of grain yield losses due to salinization INDICate grain yield losses of 32-48 per cent on average (Murtaza 2013). The global annual losses in irrigated crops caused by salt-induced land degradation could be about US$27.3 billion due to lost crop production (Qadir et al. 2014). The costs of inaction on these lands may result in 15-69 per cent revenue losses depending on the type and intensity of land degradation, crop variety and irrigation water quality and management (Qadir et al. 2014). Additional losses, which are not included in these estimates, cover a wide range of issues – from deterioration of animal health to decline in property values of affected farms, among others (Qadir et al. 2014)."

Figure 8.19 shows vulnerability to food security using meteorological data for the period 1981-2010 and socioeconomic data representative of the year 2010. The results INDICate that disasters such as floods and droughts are already having a strong impact on food security, and their frequency and intensity may increase as a result of climate change (Met Office Hadley Centre and World Food Programme 2018). In developing countries, agriculture absorbs about 22 per cent of the total damage and losses caused by natural hazards (FAO 2015b). Although disasters may impact rural livelihoods directly, the disruption to agricultural production and development can have negative repercussions across national economies, with devastating effects on food security, including in urban areas (Box 8.2)."
GEO6_8_5,8,20,"Waste and human health The Global Waste Management Outlook INDICates that cities generate between 7 and 10 billion tonnes of waste per year, figures that are expected to rise, even double, in lower-income African and Asian cities by 2030 (UNEP 2015). It also estimates that 3 billion people lack access to adequate waste disposal facilities, which poses health risks (infections, exposure to chemicals, dust) and generates environmental impacts (soil and water pollution, GHG emissions). An estimated 15 million people are operating globally as informal recyclers, many of them in dump sites (Binion and Gutberlet 2012). Identified health risks for these workers include exposure to chemical hazards, infections, musculoskeletal damage and poor mental health (Binion and Gutberlet 2012). Working in organized (e.g. Bolivia and Colombia), has helped to reduce the domestic waste flow to landfills and improved the livelihoods of the recyclers (UNEP 2015). A key step towards reducing the environmental and health impacts of domestic waste is to shift from regarding waste as a health and environmental threat to including a resource management perspective, using waste as a source of raw materials (UNEP 2015)."
GEO6_8_6,8,21,"have reduced access to iodine-rich marine foods. Fertilizers are often contaminated by cadmium, which is not essential to human health and is harmful in high doses (Newbigging, Yan and Le 2015). Positive effects of healthy soils in human health are related to nature’s available benefits to people (FAO 2015d). For example, some valuable antibiotics have been derived from soil microorganisms (Oliver and Gregory 2015). Food, chemicals and human health Pesticides (defined here as also including herbicides) have generated an almost universal human exposure to synthetic chemicals, many of which are harmful and even fatal at high doses (Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al. 2016). However, there is much uncertainty concerning the health effects of chronic exposure to pesticides at lower doses. While human exposure to some chemicals, such as organochlorines, has reduced in recent years due to regulation, other synthetic compounds have entered the human food chain, such as other pesticides, artificial sweeteners and colorants. The health effects of these substances, whether in isolation or combination, are very difficult to determine for reasons including uncertainty concerning exposure, varying rates and times of the accumulation of these compounds and their release from human tissue, and the lag between exposure and disease. In 1990, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated an annual 735,000 cases of specific chronic effects linked to pesticides globally (WHO and UNEP 1990), but pesticide use has increased dramatically since then, especially in developing countries where lax regulations and an absence of compliance mechanisms expose millions of farmers and workers to pesticides capable of causing chronic effects that include cancers; reproductive, respiratory, immune and neurological effects; and much more (Watts and Williamson 2015). There is good evidence from high-income countries that groups occupationally exposed to pesticides, such as farmers, have higher rates of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, attributed to pesticides (Schinasi and Leon 2014). Higher than expected rates of Parkinson’s disease have also been related to occupational exposure to pesticides (Liew et al. 2014). Other factors that influence health, such as age, undernutrition and impaired immune status, may also interact with the health effects of pesticides, but this issue is currently under-studied. The health effects of chronic pesticide exposures vary considerably on women and men due to their different physiologies. Data on pesticide use (and protection) by women and men in food production are incomplete and inconsistent. Overall, men are less sensitive than women to many pesticides (Hardell 2003; Watts 2007; Watts 2013). Pesticides and breast cancer rates have a strong connection (Watts 2007; Watts 2013) and women are more vulnerable than men to endocrine disruption from pesticides (Howard 2003). On the other hand, men are more sensitive to some (other) pesticides (Alavanja et al. 2003). Food quality can also be impaired through biotic contamination, both microbiological and fungal (Gnonlonfin et al. 2013). Mycotoxins, including aflatoxins, can be generated when cereals are damaged by rain, both pre-harvest and through poor storage and are an important cause of liver cancer in many low-income settings (Wild and Gong 2010). 8.5.3 Tenure security Land tenure, land deals Despite heavy reliance on land resources, communities, especially in the global South, frequently lack ownership of the land they farm or hold in common. While high-impact scientific studies on the causal linkages between tenure security and food security are lacking (Ghebru and Stein 2013; Holden and Ghebru 2016; Lawry et al. 2017), there is sufficient evidence to show that food and energy security of local communities is profoundly diminished when they lose reliable access to their land resources (Godfray et al. 2010; Muchomba 2017; Tomei and Ravindranath 2018). Land and housing are the most important assets in large sections of the world. Secure rights, for both men and women, can help turn these assets into economic opportunities (Doss, Kieran and Kilic 2017). It also allows communities to tap into the benefits of institutional support and regulation (Dekker 2016). Indigenous populations, the poor, landless and women are among the most vulnerable to the repercussions of unequal landownership and access (Narh et al. 2016). While the precise amount of community land in the world is unknown, estimates suggest that only approximately 10 per cent of formal land rights are registered or recorded worldwide (Veit and Reytar 2017). Estimates INDICate that local communities and indigenous people depend on and manage 50-65 per cent of the world’s land area (Alden Wily 2011; Pearce 2016), yet many governments still recognize their rights over only a fraction of these lands (Rights and Resources Initiative [RRI] 2015) (Figure 8.23).

GEO6_8_7,8,22,"There is increasing evidence of local indigenous communities successfully managing and conserving lands (Box 8.3). The World Resources Institute (Ding et al. 2016; Veit and Reytar 2017) INDICates that ‘tenure-secure’ indigenous lands generate billions and sometimes trillions of dollars’ worth of benefits in the form of clean water, erosion control, carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, and a suite of other local, regional and global ecosystem services (Figure 8.25). per country (top), land deal area per country (bottom)"
GEO6_8_8,8,26,"it would encourage unprofitable use of inputs (Figure 8.27) (Baltzer and Hansen 2011). The same study INDICates that, in Malawi, the subsidy ratio jumped from 79 per cent to 91 per cent or from 3.4 per cent to 6.6 per cent of GDP in 2008-2009. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the contribution of fertilizer subsidies to national food security strategies remains highly controversial (Druilhe and Barreiro-Hurlé 2012). Success in the Asian Green Revolution was based on two main food crops grown under irrigation, wheat and rice. In SSA countries, yield response to fertilizer application is observed for some crops (e.g. maize), but not for most other staple crops grown in rain-fed areas (e.g. cassava, plantain, yam). In these contexts, fertilizer use is not profitable under market conditions, especially in some remote areas where output prices are too low. In order to be effective, agricultural programmes should be complemented with other government investments in infrastructure, education, health and rural development (Druilhe and Barreiro-Hurlé 2012) (Figure 8.28). Reducing farm subsidies in rich countries would be positive for poor countries, although the effect will depend on their economic, trade and poverty characteristics (Boysen, Jensen and Matthews 2016). Meanwhile, the availability of subsidies in rich countries does not provide an incentive to adopt innovative soil conservation strategies. For a long time, the market price of crops has been the standard for determining land-use policy. However, a new trend is being observed in growing competition between the financial and economic values of land. Land speculation and land grabbing can distort the actual economic value generated by land. With increasing land scarcity, the trend to consider land as a ‘commodity’ is only strengthened (ELD 2013). As land prices increase, more farmland will be sold to outsiders purely for speculative purposes. Consequently, lands might be left idle for some time, leading to less agricultural production, exacting a significant social cost if the practice becomes widespread. In the EU, inflationary pressures are fueling land speculation and the acquisition of farmland. This rapid inflation has been attributed to the rise of ‘new investors’ in farmland, some with little connection to agriculture or farming. This process has"

Global climate change interacts with weather and local-scale climate effects, as well as unsustainable water uses and diversions, leading to dramatic impacts such as shrinking freshwater bodies (e.g. Lake Chad, see Box 9.1; the Aral Sea; the disappearing wetlands of Islamic Republic of Iran [e.g. Lake Urmia] and the Iraqi Marshes; and even the Caspian Sea (Rodell et al. 2018)). lakes and wetlands 9"

GEO6_9_3,9,17,"Fragmentation of rivers through dam building and water diversion, with resultant wetland habitat losses and degradation, has a significant impact on fish populations, especially migratory and endemic fish species. Fish populations are also being overexploited for food. Amphibian species are experiencing dramatic declines through habitat loss, invasive species, disease and pollution, followed by climate change (WWF 2016) (see Figure 9.15). Reptiles and many bird species are deeply affected by loss of wetlands, while aquatic mammals such as otters also suffer local extinctions from habitat loss and overexploitation.

Recent analyses INDICate an 81 per cent decline in LPI in freshwater ecosystems between 1970 and 2012, the highest of any habitat type monitored using this INDEX (WWF 2016). The LPI declined by 41 per cent over this period for migratory fish, based on measurement of over 162 fish species (Figure 9.16). Some improvement is evident from 2008 onwards, in response to removing weirs, installing fish ladders, and improving the up- and downstream passage of migratory fish in many places. Migratory species of birds and mammal populations in certain managed wetlands are also starting to recover, in response to habitat conservation and restocking. In contrast, the decline in amphibian and invertebrate wetland species, including insects, is much higher (WWF 2016). 9 .7 Water infrastructure 9.7.1 Drinking water supply: treatment and distribution Provision of safe, reliable drinking water is a continuing goal of development institutions, requiring modernization of ageing infrastructure and construction of new infrastructure. In many parts of the world, the original infrastructure is deteriorating, requiring upgrading. Provision of drinking water services has not kept pace with the rate of urbanization in many Latin American and Caribbean cities (UNEP 2016f; World Health Organization [WHO] and United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF] 2016). The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water by 2015 was achieved by 2010, although progress was uneven across urban and rural populations in all regions (WHO and UNICEF 2015) (Figure 9.17). across regions"

Women in India spend an estimated 150 million workdays per year collecting and carrying water, the equivalent of a national income loss of 10 billion rupees (approximately US$160 million per year). The positive impacts of women being able to spend time on other activities should be widely acknowledged, since economic surveys INDICate they typically reinvest up to 90 per cent of their income in their families, improving family health and nutrition, and increasing access to schooling for their children (Unilever et al. 2015). drinking water services and disproportionate impact on services But women still spend"

Increased sediment trapping associated with reservoirs has been linked to subsidence in deltaic areas and reduced soil fertility, for example the White Volta delta (Boateng, Bray and Hooke 2012; Anthony 2015). Recent construction of large dams has generated significant controversy in many areas, including Africa (e.g. Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam; Yihdego, Khalil and Salem 2017), Turkey, the Balkans and the Mekong basin. Drought is a major risk for hydroelectric power generation. Brazil experienced one of its most debilitating droughts ever in 2015, resulting in decreased reservoir water levels and flows, with many hydroelectric power facilities nearing zero capacity, and causing water shortages to several major Brazilian cities, including São Paulo (PoINDEXter 2015). The Brazilian example demonstrates the need to foresee conditions that must be dealt with by engineering systems while striving to find an even balance between guaranteeing water supplies and minimizing social or environmental costs."
