CMS_G1_T1,Goal 1: Address the underlying causes of decline of migratory species by mainstreaming relevant conservation and sustainable use priorities across government and society,"Target 1: People are aware of the multiple values of migratory species and their habitats and migration systems, and the steps they can take to conserve them and ensure the sustainability of any use.","Note: “Awareness” here is intended to be more than passive, and to include positive support and engagement at political levels, as well as among the public. It includes awareness of the values represented by the phenomenon of migration itself. The values concerned may be socio-economic, including cultural, as well as ecological.",T1,T16,"Levels of engagement in World Migratory Bird Day and similar events; {Trends in awareness and attitudes to migratory species}
","This could measure numbers of events reported, or number of countries in which active events occur. In certain countries where a given event is repeated in a standard way from year to year, data on numbers of people or media coverage may also be available. This is based on one of the AHTEG biodiversity indicators, although it is one that is not yet operational. There is an existing “Biodiversity Barometer” BIP indicator, but data for that will not be able to generate this indicator, since the Barometer is based on testing awareness of the definition of the word biodiversity. Development of a new indicator would therefore be required. This might be examined in conjunction with any revision/rolling forward of the CMS Outreach and Communication Plan."
CMS_G1_T2,Goal 1: Address the underlying causes of decline of migratory species by mainstreaming relevant conservation and sustainable use priorities across government and society,"Target 2: Multiple values of migratory species and their habitats have been integrated into international, national and local development and poverty reduction strategies and planning processes, including on livelihoods, and are being incorporated into national accounting, as appropriate, and reporting systems.",Note: Actions towards this SPMS target may also contribute to SPMS target 13.,T2,T14,{Trends in integration of migratory species values in national and sectoral policies},"The CMS National Report Format currently asks whether the conservation of migratory species features in national or regional policies/plans, and an indicator might be developed from that foundation (accepting that this method will give an incomplete picture, given that the target applies equally to non-CMS Party countries). Addressing migratory species through NBSAPs, which is effectively a sub-indicator of this indicator, is also specifically covered in the Report Format but belongs instead under SPMS target 13 below. Similar sub-indicators could perhaps however be considered here, e.g. for PRSPs and other globally standardized policy instruments of relevance."
CMS_G1_T3,Goal 1: Address the underlying causes of decline of migratory species by mainstreaming relevant conservation and sustainable use priorities across government and society,"Target 3: National, regional and international governance arrangements and agreements affecting migratory species and their migration systems have improved significantly, making relevant policy, legislative and implementation processes more coherent, accountable, transparent, participatory, equitable and inclusive.","Note: Reference to governance “affecting” migratory species here indicates that this is not limited only to conservation governance, but extends to other levels/sectors that may also have an effect.",,,{Activity status/viability of CMS Family of instruments}; {Other governance-related indicator on CMS implementation},"The first suggested indicator here would aim to assess the coherent governance of the CMS Family structure, by perhaps measuring the proportion of instruments which are actively and sustainably operating as intended. Metrics for this might be derived from the MoU viability study conducted in 2014.
The exact scope of the second indicator remains to be elaborated, and depends on the extent to which it proves possible to develop a governance-related performance effectiveness indicator linked specifically to implementation of the CMS (being the most relevant governance framework). There would be complexities in establishing benchmarks for matters which are for national political discretion. The most promising prospect may lie with the existing encouragement for CMS Parties to establish and operate national liaison systems or committees (target 4.5 in the 2006-2014 CMS Strategic Plan). The Convention’s National Report Format asks a question on this, but at present it is simply a yes/no question as to the existence of such a system or committee (and will give an incomplete picture, given that the target applies equally to non-CMS Party countries)."
CMS_G1_T4,Goal 1: Address the underlying causes of decline of migratory species by mainstreaming relevant conservation and sustainable use priorities across government and society,"Target 4: Incentives, including subsidies, harmful to migratory species, and/or their habitats are eliminated, phased out or reformed in order to minimize or avoid negative impacts, and positive incentives for the conservation of migratory species and their habitats are developed and applied, consistent with engagements under the CMS and other relevant international and regional obligations and commitments.","Note: The precise approach to this will vary, in some cases sub-nationally, according to specific local circumstances.",T3,T18,"{CMS National Report Format question, to ask about progress in implementing target 4}","The migratory species conservation community will want to pay attention to information reported on incentives and biodiversity in general under the two relevant indicators defined by the CBD AHTEG; but it is difficult to see how the data on those could be meaningfully disaggregated to tell a story that is specific to migratory species. Occasional case studies might be able to do so, but probably not a globally-applicable, regularly-reported indicator. The suggested route to follow for an indicator therefore is to collate narrative information in a standardized way via CMS Party National Reports, focusing the question on the migratory species dimension (and accepting that this method will give an incomplete picture, given that the target applies equally to non-CMS Party countries)."
CMS_G2_T5,Goal 2: Reduce the direct pressures on migratory species and their habitats,"Target 5: Governments, key sectors and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption, keeping the impacts of use of natural resources, including habitats, on migratory species well within safe ecological limits to promote the favourable conservation status of migratory species and maintain the quality, integrity, resilience, and ecological connectivity of their habitats and migration routes.","Note: Where there is uncertainty about what constitutes a “safe ecological limit” in a given case, a precautionary approach should be taken.",T4; T6,T15; T16; T5; T9; T10,Status of migratory species in trade,"This indicator is proposed as a migratory species ”cut” of the corresponding BIP indicator (which is said to be ready for use). As well as generating stories about the species concerned, comparisons will be possible between the migratory species sub-set and the trends for all species. The indicator addresses exploitation of migratory animals themselves, and thus does not really speak to the sense in which the target addresses impacts on such species from exploitation of other resources (that dimension may have to be caught instead by proxies defined under other targets). Nonetheless it may offer useful data on more direct exploitation (and is relevant to cooperation between CMS and CITES). NB the “footprint” indicators listed against the corresponding Aichi targets (4 and 7) are ecosystem-based and do not lend themselves to separating out any specific migratory species storylines."
CMS_G2_T6,Goal 2: Reduce the direct pressures on migratory species and their habitats,"Target 6: Fisheries and hunting have no significant direct or indirect adverse impacts on migratory species, their habitats or their migration routes, and impacts of fisheries and hunting are within safe ecological limits.","Note: Achievement of this target will require that migratory species are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and through the use of ecosystem-based approaches. Overexploitation of migratory species must be avoided, and recovery plans and measures should be in place for all depleted species. Where there is uncertainty about what constitutes a “safe ecological limit” in a given case, a precautionary approach should be taken.",T6,T5; T9; T10,Proportion of migratory fish stocks in safe biological limits,"This indicator is proposed as a migratory species ”cut” of the corresponding BIP indicator, which is said (by both BIP and AHTEG) to be ready for use; and is an indicator referred to by many international instruments e.g. the Law of the Sea, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and the MDGs. Monitoring of some other aspects of this target, including hunting impacts, may be picked up through indicators defined for targets 5, 7 and 8."
CMS_G2_T7,Goal 2: Reduce the direct pressures on migratory species and their habitats,"Target 7: Multiple anthropogenic pressures have been reduced to levels that are not detrimental to the conservation of migratory species or to the functioning, integrity, ecological connectivity and resilience of their habitats.","Note: The pressures concerned may include those relating to climate change, renewable energy developments, power lines, by-catch, underwater noise, ship strikes, poisoning, pollution, disease, invasive species, illegal and unsustainable take and marine debris.",T8; T9; T10,T7; T6; T8,Trends in threats to migratory species (overall); Trends in threats to migratory species (sub-indicators on specific threat types); {Further sub-indicators on additional/more specific threat types},"These indicators require some development, but doing so should be a priority, and while the question is complex, it should be possible to generate at least some useful data on a regular basis. Isolating migratory species threats from existing monitoring systems could be complex, and monitoring trends in e.g. distribution of “obstacles to migration” may not necessarily be usable proxies for actual impact, so those angles are problematic. CMS National Reports however generate information on threats specifically relating to migrants, and although the information is rough and anecdotal (and will give an incomplete picture, given that the target applies equally to non-CMS Party countries), it may provide a pragmatic entry-point. Other threat monitoring systems should be examined for the scope to extract a migratory species “cut” of their data.
Sub-indicators on specific threat types may in some cases be the easier starting-point and will have useful specificity for targeting policy responses. The “overall” indicator is important too however, since target 7 is mainly concerned with the additive nature of all threats (and it is instructive to detect trends in the relative importance of different types).
(Extinction risk here is regarded as a state indicator rather than a pressure indicator, so is better considered under target 8)."
CMS_G3_T8,Goal 3: Improve the conservation status of migratory species and the ecological  connectivity and resilience of their habitats,"Target 8: The conservation status of all migratory species, especially threatened species, has considerably improved throughout their range.",Note: Actions towards this SPMS target may also contribute to SPMS target 11.,T12,T4,Red List Index for migratory species;  Living Planet Index for migratory species; Wild Bird Index for migratory birds; {Trends in distribution of migratory species},"The three indicators proposed here are seemingly feasible sub-sets of existing indicators currently in operation (for details see BIP). Reporting should be designed so as to cross-refer specifically (where appropriate) to the CMS Appendices and/or Appendices in CMS daughter instruments. 
This proposal is based on an indicator that is a CBD “priority to be developed”, and addresses the key element of favourable status for migrants which relates to maintenance of range. Graduated measurement of this for most species will be difficult; but a crude index to begin with might be built on a basis of changes in the regularly-maintained CMS lists of Range States for Annex-listed species. This is unlikely to show any but the most drastic and time-lagged changes; and the Range State list updating process suffers from some quality control issues which would also need to be addressed. The method could potentially be adapted for use for example at the level of sub-national administrative regions."
CMS_G3_T9,Goal 3: Improve the conservation status of migratory species and the ecological  connectivity and resilience of their habitats,"Target 9: International and regional action and cooperation between States for the conservation and effective management of migratory species fully reflects a migration systems approach, in which all States sharing responsibility for the species concerned engage in such actions in a concerted way.","Note: The Convention on Migratory Species, being “concerned particularly with those species of wild animals that migrate across or outside national jurisdictional boundaries”, emphasizes that “conservation and effective management of migratory species of wild animals require the concerted action of all States within the national jurisdictional boundaries of which such species spend any part of their life cycle”. This would include the necessary capacity building as a key component of  trans-boundary cooperation. Target 9 seeks more complete engagement by all of the States who share joint responsibility in such circumstances.",,,{Trends in range-related coverage of migratory species agreements and other concerted actions between States},"This indicator requires development. A large component of it (though not necessarily all) could begin from existing information on the ratification status of CMS Family Agreements, formal Concerted and Cooperative Actions and Species Action Plans in the framework of the CMS. To operationalize the indicator for this target however will require the additional step of relating this information to data on species ranges, since the purpose is to show completeness of international participation in respect of each of the species concerned. Range data are already collated under CMS auspices at the level of Range State lists, although this suffers from some quality control issues which would need to be addressed. The indicator title is necessarily abbreviated; but “other concerted actions” should be understood as embracing action plans and equivalents (i.e. not only the specific “concerted actions” mechanism as formally established by CMS); and “coverage” should be understood as (potentially at least) embracing both geographical coverage and a measure of active engagement by Range States."
CMS_G3_T10,Goal 3: Improve the conservation status of migratory species and the ecological  connectivity and resilience of their habitats,"Target 10: All critical habitats and sites for migratory species are identified and included in area-based conservation measures so as to maintain their quality, integrity, resilience and functioning in accordance with the implementation of Aichi Target 11, supported where necessary by environmentally sensitive land-use planning and landscape management on a wider scale.","Note: Aichi Target 11 states that “at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes”.",T5; T11,T1; T3,"{Trends in conservation status, including connectivity, of identified habitats of key importance for migratory species}; {Coverage of key habitats for migratory species in protected areas}; {Management effectiveness of areas protected specifically for migratory species}","The first of these three indicators picks up on the AHTEG indicator “Trends in the connectivity of protected and other area based approaches integrated into land and seascapes”. It will require development. Its feasibility poses considerable challenges, such as devising a valid method for systematically identifying habitats with this specific relevance, deciding how to measure changes in connectivity, and relating this meaningfully to impacts on migratory species.
Indicators of fragmentation of forests and rivers are already under discussion in a wider biodiversity context, but translating these into effects on migration is difficult.
The migratory species conservation community will want to pay attention to information reported on more general indicators of particular habitat types and ecosystem trends which are associated with the corresponding Aichi Target 5, but there appears to be no good rationale upon which to propose a “cut” of any of those which could isolate migratory species factors.
Concerning the second and third issues listed above, it may be possible to develop some kind of indicators as sub-sets of the corresponding three more generic BIP indicators on these subjects, which are all classed as ready for use (with the “coverage” and “overlays” BIP indicators both contributing to the first of the two migratory species proposals above). Isolating the components that relate specifically to migratory species however will require considerable work, and is likely to be challenging. One way to disaggregate the existing management effectiveness indicator data might be to separate out all sites covered by it which are included in flyway sites networks (and to apply the methodology to such sites where they are not already assessed for this).
Further elaboration of an approach to this also depends on addressing issues relating to absent or uncertain baselines for the quantitative elements of the corresponding Aichi target, and for the totality for sites regarded as critically important for migratory species.
The worthwhileness of investing in these indicators may need careful evaluation."
CMS_G4_T11,Goal 4: Enhance the benefits to all from the favourable conservation status of migratory species,"Target 11: Migratory species and their habitats which provide important ecosystem services are maintained at or restored to favourable conservation status, taking into account the needs of women, indigenous and local communities7, and the poor and vulnerable.","Note: The services concerned may include water supply, quality and regulation; disaster risk reduction; climate regulation; cultural services; food and other socio-economic benefits, all contributing to people’s health, livelihoods and well-being. Actions towards this SPMS target may also contribute to SPMS target 8.",T14; T15,T11; T23; T2,{Trends in delivery of ecosystem services directly dependent on migratory species},"The proposed indicator is a composite of the most relevant components of the CBD and BIP indicators which are matched to the Aichi target (14) that corresponds to this proposed migratory species target, and which include some that are ready for use and some that are in development. Work would be required to define relevant selected services, to isolate and specify cause-effect dependence on named migratory species, and to devise parameters for measurement that are linked to this dependence and do not simply repeat the species-status assessments which are already the subject of target 8 above. The proposal addresses this by aiming to measure benefits that are derived by people rather than the status of the species, although this extrapolates slightly beyond the strict scope of the target (which goes only as far as securing the potential for benefit).
The development of ecosystem services indicators is very challenging; but it might be possible to isolate particular services from particular migratory species to act as a sample of this issue. It would be preferable to select something that is not direct consumptive use, since that is covered under other indicators; so perhaps eg pollination or grazing-related services would be the priority."
CMS_G4_T12,Goal 4: Enhance the benefits to all from the favourable conservation status of migratory species,"Target 12: The genetic diversity of wild populations of migratory species is safeguarded, and strategies have been developed and implemented for minimizing genetic erosion.","Note: Safeguarding actions may include maintenance of the original gene pool for migratory species that are managed under human care for re-introduction into the wild and other purposes, or are otherwise of socio-economic as well as cultural value.",T13,T4,Strategies of relevance to migratory species developed and implemented for minimizing genetic erosion,"Given the difficulty in devising a realistic outcome indicator for the target, the most feasible course is probably to report on the “means objective” forming the second part of the target. Limiting this to strategies addressing only migratory species might narrow the scope too strictly; hence the reference in this instance only to strategies that are “of relevance” to migratory species.
Existing indicators are not well suited to addressing genetic erosion in wild animals. This may be a case where progress towards the outcome of a Strategic Plan target can only be assessed by “exception reporting”, i.e. maintaining reactive vigilance and perhaps annual reminder checks to document any instances of notable moves towards or away from the defined target state"
CMS_G5_T13,"Goal 5: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building","Target 13: Priorities for effective conservation and management of migratory species, their habitats and migration systems have been included in the development and implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans, with reference where relevant to CMS agreements and action plans and their implementation bodies.","Note: Other types of national plans and strategies, such as those for the implementation of other Multilateral Environmental Agreements or national development plans, may also be highly relevant. Even if they are not designed overtly to have biodiversity-related purposes, plans for issues such as land use, resource use, public health, disaster risk reduction, infrastructure distribution and economic development can include provisions that make an important difference to migratory species conservation. Actions towards this SPMS target may also contribute to SPMS target 2.",T17,,Trends in attention to migratory species in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans; {Trends in integration of migratory species concerns in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans},"The CMS National Report Format currently asks whether migratory species are addressed by each country’s NBSAP, and an indicator could be developed from that foundation (accepting that this method will give an incomplete picture, given that the target applies equally to non-CMS Party countries). It is likely that it would only go as far as tracking the presence or absence of references to migratory species in NBSAPs, since this is all that most Parties are likely to report in response to the existing National Report question.
This goes further than the first indicator defined above, by addressing not just presence or absence of reference to migratory species, but the manner in which migratory species concerns are integrated into the Strategy/Action Plan. “Trends” perhaps overstates the position, since it is likely that this would be based on occasional qualitative assessment of NBSAP content with this specific question in view, and the most that might be expected is a comparison between a moment early in the time-span of the SPMS and a moment at or near the end of its time-span.
Target 13 is effectively a sub-target of target 2 above, and the indicator would therefore operate as a sub-indicator of the indicator proposed there."
CMS_G5_T14,"Goal 5: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building","Target 14: The traditional knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of migratory species, their habitats and migration systems, and their customary sustainable use of biological resources, are respected, subject to national legislation and relevant international obligations, with the full and effective participation of indigenous and local communities, thereby contributing to the favourable conservation status of migratory species and the ecological connectivity and resilience of their habitats.",Note: This target reflects international thinking on the subject in other fora.,T18,T21; T22,"{Trends in the degree to which traditional knowledge and practices are respected through full integration, participation and safeguards in national implementation of the Strategic Plan for Migratory Species}","This indicator is modelled on one of the CBD AHTEG proposals for the corresponding Aichi Target 18 (listed as a “priority for development”), but here referring to the Migratory Species Plan rather than the Biodiversity Plan. The “knowledge and practices” at issue would similarly need to be more specific to migratory species matters.
The most pragmatic way to develop this indicator might be to add a question to the CMS National Report Format (accepting that this method will give an incomplete picture, given that the target applies equally to non-CMS Party countries). This would need careful wording and a scaled response, rather than just yes/no."
CMS_G5_T15,"Goal 5: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building","Target 15: The science base, information, training, awareness, understanding and technologies relating to migratory species, their habitats and migration systems, their value, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of their loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and effectively applied.","Note: The “science base” here does not relate only to new research and monitoring, but also to making better use of existing datasets (including improving their public availability), and improving the standardization of data collection protocols. In addition to investigation and understanding of specific events, phenomena, patterns and consequences, greater efforts may also be required to improve data on baseline conditions, so that meaningful assessments of significance, and assessments of change, can be made.",T19,T20; T21;T22,{Trends in publication of papers on migratory species conservation in peer-reviewed literature},"A method of globally measuring this indicator requires development, perhaps by defining internet and database search protocols. The indicator does not address the “effective application” part of the target, but an operable way of doing that is not easy to see. The relevant CBD AHTEG and BIP indicators (not yet in use) refer more specifically to sub-global assessments and species inventories - both of these are included in the interpretation of “publications” here, provided they are peer-reviewed; but the indicator here is intended not to be so narrowly prescribed as the AHTEG/BIP ones are."
CMS_G5_T16,"Goal 5: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building",Target 16: The mobilization of adequate resources from all sources to implement the Strategic Plan for Migratory Species effectively has increased substantially.,"Note: This target refers to resource mobilization in the broad sense including international and domestic funding from public, private and other sources. It however also implies policy choices that reduce the costs of improving the status of migratory species and thus also benefits from the correct implementation of Goals 1 and 2. Developing countries, least developed countries, small island developing states and countries with economies in transition have particularly acute needs in this regard. Resource flows to as well as within these countries need to increase, both through ”north south” and “south-south” cooperation.",T20,T19,{Trends in official funding for actions which support implementation of the Strategic Plan for Migratory Species},"Indicators defined for the CBD Resource Mobilization Strategy (and listed there as “priorities for development”) might suggest that a suitable indicator for this target could be developed in relation to aggregated annual international flows of funding for achieving the goals of the SPMS, and something similar for the national level. During the development of the SPMS, however, considerable doubt was cast on the feasibility of making such indicators operable, at least for in terms of disaggregating the “migratory species” dimension of biodiversity.
The indicator suggested here, although crude and partial, may therefore be the most that can be expected. It would address major documentable instances of support for migratory species conservation programmes and projects, ideally where a link to one or more SPMS targets is explicit. This could include specific relevant instances of funding by multilateral bodies such as the GEF, and support from governments for actions under the CMS and its Family of instruments, among other actions.
There is a significant methodological challenge in defining appropriate baselines for 2015, and this will also require attention."
