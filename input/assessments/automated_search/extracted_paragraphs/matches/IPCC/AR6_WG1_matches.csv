Here, we summarize changes to a set of key large-scale climate INDICATORs over the modern era (1850 to present). We also discuss the changes in relation to the longer-term evolution of the climate. These ongoing changes throughout the climate system form a key part of the context of the present Report."
AR6_WG1_1_3,1,13,1.2.1.1 Recent Changes in Multiple Climate INDICATORs
AR6_WG1_1_4,1,13,"Figure 1.4 documents that the climate system is undergoing a comprehensive set of changes. It shows a selection of key INDICATORs of change through the instrumental era that are assessed and presented in the subsequent chapters of this report. Annual mean values are shown as stripes, with colours INDICating their value. The transitions from one colour to another over time illustrate how conditions are shifting in all components of the climate system. For these particular INDICATORs, the observed changes go beyond the yearly and decadal variability of the climate system. In this Report, this is termed an ‘emergence’ of the climate signal (Section 1.4.2 and FAQ 1.2)."
AR6_WG1_1_5,1,14,"The hydrological (or water) cycle is also changing and is assessed to be intensifying, through a higher exchange of water between the surface and the atmosphere (Sections 2.3 and 8.3). The resulting regional patterns of changes to precipitation are, however, different from surface temperature change, and interannual variability is larger, as illustrated in Figure 1.4. Annual land area mean precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere temperate regions has increased, while the subtropical dry regions have experienced a decrease in precipitation in recent decades (Section 2.3). The cryosphere is undergoing rapid changes, with increased melting and loss of frozen water mass in most regions. This includes all frozen parts of the globe, such as terrestrial snow, permafrost, sea ice, glaciers, freshwater ice, solid precipitation, and the ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica (Chapter 9; SROCC, IPCC, 2019b). Figure 1.4 illustrates how, globally, glaciers have been increasingly losing mass for the last fifty years. The total glacier mass in the most recent decade (2010–2019) was the lowest since the beginning of the 20th century (Sections 2.3 and 9.5). The global ocean has warmed unabatedly since at least 1970 (Sections 1.3, 2.3 and 9.2; SROCC, IPCC, 2019b). Figure 1.4 shows how the averaged ocean heat content is steadily increasing, with a total increase of [0.28 to 0.55] yottajoule (YJ; 10 24 joule) between 1971 and 2018 (Section 9.2). In response to this ocean warming, as well as to the loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets, the global mean sea level (GMSL) has risen by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] metres between 1900 and 2018. GMSL rise has accelerated since the late 1960s (see Section 9.6). Overall, the changes in these selected climatic INDICATORs have progressed beyond the range of natural year-to-year variability (Chapters 2, 3, 8 and 9, and Sections 1.2.1.2 and 1.4.2). The INDICATORs presented in Figure 1.4 document a broad set of concurrent and emerging changes across the physical climate system. All INDICATORs shown here, along with many others, are further presented in the coming chapters, together with a rigorous assessment of the supporting scientific literature. Later chapters (Chapters 10, 11, 12 and Atlas) present similar assessments at the regional level, where observed changes do not always align with the global mean picture shown here."
AR6_WG1_1_6,1,16,"This establishes an essential long-term context for the climate change of the past 150 years and the projected changes in the 21st century and beyond (Chapter 3; IPCC, 2013a; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013). Figure 1.5 shows reconstructions of three key INDICATORs of climate change over the past 800,000 years (800 kyr) 2 – atmospheric CO concentrations, global mean surface temperature (GMST) and global mean sea level (GMSL) – comprising at least eight complete glacial–interglacial cycles (EPICA Community Members, 2004; Jouzel et al., 2007), which are largely driven by oscillations in the Earth’s orbit and consequent feedbacks on multi-millennial time scales (Berger, 1978; Laskar et al., 1993). The dominant cycles – recurring approximately every 100 kyr – can be found imprinted in the natural variations of these three key INDICATORs. Before industrialisation, atmospheric CO concentrations varied between 174 ppm and 300 ppm, as measured directly in air trapped in ice at Dome Concordia, Antarctica (Bereiter et al., 2015; Nehrbass-Ahles et al., 2020). Relative to 1850–1900 CE, the reconstructed GMST changed in the range of –6°C to +1°C across these glacial–interglacial cycles (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1 for an assessment of different paleo-reference periods). GMSL varied between about –130 m during the coldest glacial maxima and +5 to +25 m during the warmest interglacial periods (Chapter 2; Spratt and Lisiecki, 2016). They represent the amplitudes of natural, global-scale climate variations over the last 800 kyr prior to the influence of human activity. Further climate information from a variety of paleoclimatic archives is assessed in Chapters 2, 5, 7 and 9."
AR6_WG1_1_7,1,16,"Paleoclimatic information also provides a long-term perspective on rates of change of these three key INDICATORs. In high-resolution reconstructions from polor ice cores, the rate of increase in atmospheric CO observed over 1919–2019 CE is one order of magnitude higher than the fastest CO fluctuations documented during the Last Glacial Maximum and the last deglacial transition (Marcott et al., 2014, see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.3.2.1). Current multi- decadal GMST exhibit a higher rate of increase than over the past 2 kyr (Section 2.3.1.1.2; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019), and in the 20th century GMSL rise was faster than during any other century over the past 3 kyr (Section 2.3.3.3)."
AR6_WG1_1_8,1,16,"Paleoclimate records also show centennial- to millennial-scale variations, particularly during the ice ages, which INDICate rapid or abrupt changes of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC; Section 9.2.3.1) and the occurrence of a ‘bipolar seesaw’ (opposite-phase surface temperature changes in both hemispheres; Section 2.3.3.4.1; Stocker and Johnsen, 2003; EPICA Community Members, 2006; WAIS Divide Project Members et al., 2015; Lynch- Stieglitz, 2017; Pedro et al., 2018; Weijer et al., 2019). This process suggests that instabilities and irreversible changes could be triggered if critical thresholds are passed (Section 1.4.4.3). Several other processes involving instabilities are identified in climate models (Drijfhout et al., 2015), some of which may now be close to critical thresholds (Section 1.4.4.3; see also Chapters 5, 8 and 9 regarding tipping points; Joughin et al., 2014)."
AR6_WG1_1_9,1,16,"Based on Figure 1.5, the reconstructed, observed and projected ranges of changes in the three key INDICATORs can be compared. By the first decade of the 20th century, atmospheric CO concentrations had already moved outside the reconstructed range of natural variation"

AR6_WG1_1_13,1,27,"Budescu et al. (2014) surveyed 25 samples in 24 countries (a total of 10,792 individual responses), finding that even when shown IPCC uncertainty guidance, lay readers systematically misunderstood IPCC likelihood statements. When presented with a ‘high likelihood’ statement, they understood it as INDICating a lower likelihood than intended by the IPCC authors. Conversely, they interpreted ‘low likelihood’ statements as INDICating a higher likelihood than intended. In another study, British lay readers interpreted uncertainty language somewhat differently from IPCC guidance, but Chinese lay people reading the same uncertainty language translated into Chinese differed much more in their interpretations (Harris et al., 2013). Further, even though it is objectively more probable that wide uncertainty intervals will encompass true values, wide intervals were interpreted by lay people as implying subjective uncertainty or lack of knowledge on the part of scientists (Løhre et al., 2019). Mach et al. (2017) investigated the advances and challenges in approaches to expert judgment in AR5. Their analysis showed that the shared framework increased the overall comparability of assessment conclusions across all Working Groups and topics related to climate change, from the physical science basis to resulting impacts, risks, and options for response. Nevertheless, many challenges in developing and communicating assessment conclusions persist, especially for findings drawn from multiple disciplines and Working Groups, for subjective aspects of judgements, and for findings with substantial uncertainties (Adler and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014). In summary, the calibrated language cannot entirely prevent misunderstandings, including a tendency to systematically underestimate the probability of the IPCC’s higher-likelihood conclusions and overestimate the probability of the lower-likelihood ones (high confidence). However, a consistent and systematic approach across Working Groups to communicate the assessment outcomes is an important characteristic of the IPCC."
AR6_WG1_1_14,1,27,"The framework for communicating uncertainties does not allow for INDICating cases where ‘deep uncertainty’ is identified in the assessment (Adler and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014). The definition of deep uncertainty in IPCC assessments has been described in the context of SROCC (IPCC, 2019b; Box 5 in Abram et al., 2019): a situation of deep uncertainty exists when experts or stakeholders do not know or cannot agree on: (i) appropriate conceptual models that describe relationships among key driving forces in a system; (ii) the probability distributions used to represent uncertainty about key variables and parameters; and/or (iii) how to weigh and value desirable alternative outcomes (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2 and Annex VII: Glossary; Abram et al., 2019). Since AR5, ‘storylines’ or ‘narratives’ approaches have been used to address issues related to deep uncertainty, for example low-likelihood events that would have high impact if they occurred, to better inform risk assessment and decision making (Section 1.4.4)."
AR6_WG1_1_15,1,28,"In AR6, ‘climate information’ refers to specific information about the past, current or future state of the climate system that is relevant for mitigation, adaptation and risk management. Cross-Chapter Box 1.1 is an example of climate information at the global scale. It provides climate change information with potential relevance for the global stocktake, and INDICates where in AR6 this information may be found. Responding to national and regional policymakers’ needs for tailored information relevant to risk assessment and adaptation, AR6 emphasizes assessment of regional information more than earlier reports. Here the phrase ‘regional climate information’ refers to predefined reference sets of land and ocean regions; various typological domains (such as mountains or monsoons); temporal frames including baseline periods as well as near term (2021–2040), medium term (2041–2060) and long term (2081–2100); and global warming levels (Chapters 10 and 12, Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.5, and Atlas). Regional climate change information is constructed from multiple lines of evidence including observations, paleoclimate proxies, reanalyses, attribution of changes and climate model projections from both global and regional climate models (Sections 1.5.3 and 10.2–10.4). The constructed regional information needs to take account of user context and values for risk assessment, adaptation and policy decisions (Sections 1.2.3 and 10.5)."

The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSat) was launched in 2009, and two Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellite instruments have been in orbit since 2014. The AR5 WGI highlighted ‘the other CO problem’ (Doney et al., 2009), that is, ocean acidification caused by the absorption of some 20–30% of anthropogenic CO from the atmosphere and its conversion to carbonic acid in seawater. The AR5 WGI assessed that the pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era (high confidence), INDICating approximately a 30% increase in acidity (IPCC, 2013b)."
AR6_WG1_1_17,1,38,"A key INDICATOR of climate understanding is whether theoretical climate system budgets or ‘inventories’, such as the balance of incoming and outgoing energy at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere, can be quantified and balanced observationally. The global energy budget, for example, includes energy retained in the atmosphere, upper ocean, deep ocean, ice, and land surface. Church et al. (2013) assessed in AR5 with high confidence that independent estimates of effective radiative forcing (ERF), observed heat storage, and surface warming combined to give an energy budget for the Earth that is"
AR6_WG1_1_18,1,45,"Several baselines or reference periods are used consistently throughout AR6 WGI. Baseline refers to a period against which differences are calculated, whereas reference period is used more generally to INDICate a time period of interest, or a period over which some relevant statistics are calculated (Glossary). Variations in observed and simulated climate variables over time are often presented as ‘anomalies’, that is, the differences relative to a baseline, rather than using the absolute values. This is done for several reasons. deemed very unlikely (albeit with medium confidence due to known consistent with 1.5°C global warming over the 21st century.

Since their baseline value is zero by definition, anomalies are also less susceptible to biases arising from changes in the observational network. Second, the seasonality in different climate INDICATORs can be removed using anomalies to more clearly distinguish variability from long-term trends."
AR6_WG1_1_19,1,45,"Third, different datasets can have different absolute values for the same climate variable that should be removed to allow effective comparisons of variations over time. This is often required when comparing climate simulations with each other, or when comparing simulations with observations, as simulated climate variables are also affected by model bias that can be removed when they are presented as anomalies. It can also be required when comparing observational datasets or reanalyses (Section 1.5.2) with each other, due to systematic differences in the underlying measurement system (Figure 1.11). Understanding the reasons for any absolute difference is important, but whether the simulated absolute value matters when projecting future change will depend on the variable of interest. For example, there is not a strong relationship between climate sensitivity of a model (which is an INDICATOR of the degree of future warming) and the simulated absolute global surface temperature (Mauritsen et al., 2012; Hawkins and Sutton, 2016)."

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) uses 30-year periods to define ‘climate normals’, which INDICate conditions expected to be experienced in a given location."
AR6_WG1_1_21,1,50,"see Section 1.5.4.2). A set of illustrative examples using one such large ensemble (Maher et al., 2019) demonstrates how variability can influence trends on decadal time scales (Figure 1.13). The long- term anthropogenic trends in this set of climate INDICATORs are clearly apparent when considering the ensemble as a whole (grey shading), and all the individual ensemble members have very similar trends for ocean heat content (OHC), which is a robust estimate of the total energy stored in the climate system (e.g., Palmer and McNeall, 2014). However, the individual ensemble members can exhibit very different decadal trends in global surface air temperature (GSAT), UK summer temperatures, and Arctic sea ice variations. More specifically, for a representative 11-year period, both positive and negative trends can be found in all these surface INDICATORs, even though the long- term trend is for increasing temperatures and decreasing sea ice. Periods in which the long-term trend is substantially masked or enhanced for more than 20 years are also visible in these regional examples. This highlights the fact that observations are expected to exhibit short-term trends which are larger or smaller than the long-term trend or that differ from the average projected trend from climate models, especially on continental spatial scales or smaller (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1). The actual observed trajectory can be considered as one realization of many possible alternative worlds that experienced different weather; this is also demonstrated by changes in climate the construction of ‘observation-based large ensembles’, which are alternate possible realizations of historical observations that retain the statistical properties of observed regional weather (e.g., McKinnon and Deser, 2018)."
AR6_WG1_1_22,1,55,"In the broader IPCC context, the term ‘scenario storyline’ refers to a narrative description of one or more scenarios, highlighting their main characteristics, relationships between key driving forces and the dynamics of their evolution (e.g., emissions of short-lived climate forcers assessed in Chapter 6 are driven by ‘scenario storylines’; see Section 1.6). The AR6 WGI is mainly concerned with ‘physical climate storylines’. A physical climate storyline is a self-consistent and plausible physical trajectory of the climate system, or a weather or climate event, on time scales from hours to multiple decades (T.G. Shepherd et al., 2018). This approach can be used to constrain projected changes or specific events on specified explanatory elements such as projected changes of large-scale INDICATORs (Box 10.2). For example, Hazeleger et al. (2015) suggested using ‘tales of future weather’, blending numerical weather prediction with a climate projection to illustrate the potential behaviour of future high-impact events (also see Hegdahl et al., 2020). Several studies describe how possible large changes in atmospheric circulation"
AR6_WG1_1_23,1,58,"Such paleoclimate evidence has even fuelled concerns that anthropogenic GHGs could tip the global climate into a permanent hot state (Steffen et al., 2018). However, there is no evidence of such non-linear responses at the global scale in climate projections for the next century, which INDICates a near-linear dependence of global temperature on cumulative GHG emissions (Sections 1.3.5, 5.5 and 7.4.3.1). At the regional scale, abrupt changes and tipping points, such as Amazon rainforest dieback and permafrost collapse, have occurred in projections with Earth System Models (Section 4.7.3; Drijfhout the concept of deep uncertainty are also relevant for risk assessment. whose probability of occurrence is low or not well known on society and ecosystems could be high.

In such simulations, tipping points occur in narrow regions of parameter space (e.g., CO concentration or temperature increase), and for specific climate background states. This makes them difficult to predict using Earth system models (ESMs) relying on parmeterizations of known processes. In some cases, it is possible to detect forthcoming tipping points through time- series analysis that identifies increased sensitivity to perturbations as the tipping point is approached (e.g., ‘critical slowing-down’, Scheffer et al., 2012)."

However, a growing number of studies damages induced by Hurricane Harvey; or Diffenbaugh and Burke or Schaller et al. (2016) for flood damages). aggregation of climate variables was implicitly achieved through the consideration of biomes, giving rise to the traditional vegetation- based classification of Köppen (1936). In the last decades, the substantial increases in climate observations, climate modelling, and data processing capabilities have allowed new approaches to climate classification, for example through interpolation of aggregated global data from thousands of stations (Peel et al., 2007; Belda et al., 2014; Beck et al., 2018) or through data-driven approaches applied to delineate ecoregions that behave in a coherent manner in response to climate variability (Papagiannopoulou et al., 2018). Experience shows that each method has strengths and weaknesses through trade-offs between detail and convenience. For instance, a very detailed classification, with numerous complexly shaped regions derived from a large set of variables, may be most useful for the evaluation of climate models (Rubel and Kottek, 2010; Belda et al., 2015; Beck et al., 2018) and climate projections (Feng et al., 2014; Belda et al., 2016). In contrast, geometrically simple regions are often best suited for regional climate modelling and downscaling (e.g., the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) domains; Section 1.5.3; Giorgi and Gutowski, 2015)."
AR6_WG1_1_26,1,64,"Progress in climate science relies on the quality and quantity of observations from a range of platforms: surface-based instrumental measurements, aircraft, radiosondes and other upper-atmospheric observations, satellite-based retrievals, ocean observations, and paleoclimatic records. An historical perspective to these types of observations is presented in Section 1.3.1. Observed large-scale climatic changes assessed in Chapter 2, attribution of these changes in Chapter 3, and regional observations of specific physical or biogeochemical processes presented in other Chapters, are supported by improvements in observational capacity since AR5. Attribution assessments can be made at a higher likelihood level than in AR5, due in part to the availability of longer observational datasets (Chapter 3). Updated assessments are made based on new and improved datasets, for example of global temperature change (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) or regional climate information (Section 10.2). Of particular relevance to the AR6 assessment are the Essential Climate Variables (ECVs; Hollmann et al., 2013; Bojinski et al., 2014), and Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs; Lindstrom et al., 2012), compiled by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS; WMO, 2016), and the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), respectively. These variables include physical, chemical and biological variables or groups of linked variables, and underpin ‘headline INDICATORs’ (a selected set of essential parameters representing the state of the climate system) for climate monitoring (Trewin et al., 2021). We highlight below the key advances in observational capacity since AR5, including major expansions of existing observational platforms"
AR6_WG1_1_27,1,66,"Satellite observations have recently expanded to include data on the fluorescence of land plants as a measure of photosynthetic activity via the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME; Guanter et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015) and OCO-2 satellites (Sun et al., 2017). Climate data records of leaf area INDEX (LAI), characterizing the area of green leaves per unit of ground area, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) – an important INDICATOR of photosynthetic activity and plant health (Gobron et al., 2009) – are now available for over 30 years (Claverie et al., 2016). In addition, key INDICATORs such as fire disturbances/burned areas are now retrieved via satellite (Chuvieco et al., 2019). In the US, the National Ecological Observational Network (NEON) provides continental-scale observations relevant to the assessment of changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems via a wide variety of ground-based, airborne, and satellite platforms (Keller et al., 2008).

Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation INDEX (NDVI) from MODIS and other remote-sensing platforms is widely applied to assess the effects of climate change on vegetation in drought- sensitive regions (Atampugre et al., 2019). New satellite imaging capabilities for meteorological observations, such as the advanced multispectral imager aboard Himawari-8 (Bessho et al., 2016), also allow for improved monitoring of challenging quantities such as seasonal changes of vegetation in cloudy regions (Section 2.3.4.3; Miura et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_1_29,1,67,"Major paleoreconstruction efforts completed since AR5 include a variety of large-scale, multi-proxy temperature datasets and associated reconstructions spanning the last 2000 years (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2017, 2019; Neukom et al., 2019), the Holocene (Kaufman et al., 2020), the Last Glacial Maximum (Cleator et al., 2020; Tierney et al., 2020b), the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (McClymont et al., 2020), and the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (Hollis et al., 2019). Newly compiled borehole data (Cuesta-Valero et al., 2019), as well as advances in statistical applications to tree ring data, result in more robust reconstructions of key INDICES such as Northern Hemisphere temperature over the last millennium (e.g., Wilson et al., 2016; Anchukaitis et al., 2017). Such reconstructions provide a new context for recent warming trends (Chapter 2) and serve to constrain the response of the climate system to natural and anthropogenic forcing (Chapters 3 and 7)."
AR6_WG1_1_30,1,70,"Since AR5, ocean reanalyses have improved due to: increased model resolution (Zuo et al., 2017; Lellouche et al., 2018; Heimbach et al., 2019); improved physics (Storto et al., 2019); improvements in the atmospheric forcing from atmospheric reanalyses (see Section 1.5.2.1.3); and improvements in the data quantity and quality available for assimilation (e.g., Lellouche et al., 2018; Heimbach et al., 2019), particularly due to Argo observations (Annex I; Zuo et al., 2019). The first Ocean Reanalyses Intercomparison project (ORA-IP; Balmaseda et al., 2015) focussed on the uncertainty in key climate INDICATORs, such as ocean heat content (Palmer et al., 2017), thermosteric sea level (Storto et al., 2017, 2019), salinity (Shi et al., 2017), sea ice extent (Chevallier et al., 2017), and the AMOC (Karspeck et al., 2017). Reanalysis uncertainties occur in areas of inhomogeneous or sparse observational data sampling, such as for the deep ocean, the Southern Ocean, and western boundary currents (Lellouche et al., 2018; Storto et al., 2019). Intercomparisons have also been dedicated to specific variables such as mixed-layer depths (Toyoda et al., 2017), eddy kinetic energy, globally (Masina et al., 2017) and in the polar regions (Uotila et al., 2019). Karspeck et al. (2017) found disagreement in the AMOC variability and strength in reanalyses over observation-sparse periods, whereas Jackson et al. (2019) reported a lower spread in AMOC strength across an ensemble of ocean reanalyses of the recent period (1993–2010), linked to improved observation availability for assimilation. Reanalyses also have a larger spread of ocean heat uptake than data-only products and can produce spurious overestimates of heat uptake (Palmer et al., 2017), which is important in the context of estimating climate sensitivity (Storto et al., 2019). The ensemble approach for ocean reanalyses provides another avenue for estimating uncertainties across ocean reanalyses (Storto et al., 2019). While there are still limitations in their representation of oceanic features, ocean reanalyses add value to products based only on observation, and are used to inform assessments in AR6 (Chapters 2, 3, 7 and 9). Reanalyses of the atmosphere or ocean alone may not account for important atmosphere–ocean coupling, motivating the development of coupled reanalyses (Laloyaux et al., 2018; Schepers et al., 2018; Penny et al., 2019), but these are not assessed in AR6."
AR6_WG1_1_31,1,76,"In this Report, there are two notable uses of simple climate models. One is the connection between the assessed range of ECS in Chapter 7, and the projections of future global surface air temperature (GSAT) change in Chapter 4, which is done via a two- layer model based on Held et al. (2010). It is also used as input to sea level projections in Chapter 9. The other usage is the transfer of Earth system assessment knowledge to WGIII, via a set of models (MAGICC, FaIR, CICERO-SCM) specifically tuned to represent the WGI assessment. For an overview of the uses, and an assessment of the related Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP), see Nicholls et al.

It is an open-source community software tool that includes a large variety of diagnostics and performance metrics relevant for coupled Earth system processes, such as for the mean, variability and trends, and it can also examine emergent constraints (Section 1.5.4.7). ESMValTool also includes routines provided by the WMO Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and INDICES for the evaluation of extreme events (Min et al., 2011; Sillmann et al., 2013) and diagnostics for key processes and variability.

AR6_WG1_1_33,1,92,"1.6.1.2 Scenario Generation Process for CMIP6 The scenario generation process involves research communities linked to all three IPCC Working Groups (Figure 1.27). It generally starts in the scientific communities associated with WGII and WGIII with the definition of new socio-economic scenario storylines (IPCC, 2000; O’Neill et al., 2014) that are quantified in terms of their drivers – i.e., GDP, population, technology, energy and land use – and their resulting emissions (Riahi et al., 2017). Then, numerous complementation and harmonization steps are necessary for datasets within the WGI and WGIII science communities, including gridding emissions of anthropogenic short-lived forcers, providing open biomass-burning emissions estimates, preparing land-use patterns, aerosol fields, stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, nitrogen deposition datasets, solar irradiance and aerosol optical property estimates, and observed and projected GHG concentration time WGIII Cause series (documented for CMIP6 through input4mips; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 2; Durack et al., 2018). Once these datasets are completed, ESMs are run in coordinated model intercomparison projects in the WGI science community, using standardized simulation protocols and scenario data. The most recent example of such a coordinated effort is the CMIP6 exercise (Section 1.5.4; Eyring et al., 2016) with, in particular, ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al., 2016). The WGI science community feeds back climate information to WGIII via climate emulators (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) that are updated and calibrated with the ESMs’ temperature responses and other lines of evidence. Next, this climate information is used to compute several high-level global climate INDICATORs (e.g., atmospheric concentrations, global temperatures) for a much wider set of hundreds of scenarios that are assessed as part of the IPCC WGIII Assessment (WGIII Annex C). The outcomes from climate models run under the different scenarios are then used to calculate WGII Effect"
AR6_WG1_2_1,2,7,"This chapter assesses the evidence basis for large-scale past changes in selected components of the climate system. As such, it combines much of the assessment performed in Chapters 2 through 5 of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) WGI contribution (IPCC, 2013) that, taken together, supported a finding of unequivocal recent warming of the climate system. The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) WGI Report structure differs substantially from that in AR5 (Section 1.1.2). This chapter focuses upon observed changes in climate system drivers and changes in key selected large-scale INDICATORs of climate change and in important modes of variability (Cross-Chapter Box 2.2), which allow for an assessment of changes in the global climate system in an integrated manner. This chapter is complemented by Chapters 3 and 4, which respectively consider model assessment/detection and attribution, and future climate projections for subsets of these same INDICATORs and modes. It does not consider changes in observed extremes, which are assessed in Chapter 11. The chapter structure is outlined in the visual abstract (Figure 2.1)."

AR6_WG1_2_3,2,11,"Slow periodic changes in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun mainly cause variations in seasonal and latitudinal receipt of incoming solar radiation. Precise calculations of orbital variations are available for tens of millions of years (Berger and Loutre, 1991; Laskar et al., 2011). The range of insolation averaged over boreal summer at 65°N was about 83 W m −2 during the past million years, and 3.2 W m −2 during the past millennium, but there was no substantial effect upon global average radiative forcing (0.02 W m –2 during the past millennium). A new reconstruction of solar irradiance extends back 9 kyr based upon updated cosmogenic isotope datasets and improved models for production and deposition of cosmogenic nuclides (Poluianov et al., 2016), and shows that solar activity during the second half of the 20th century was in the upper decile of the range. TSI features millennial-scale changes with typical magnitudes of 1.5 [1.4 to 2.1] W m –2 (C.-J. Wu et al., 2018). Although stronger variations in the deeper past cannot be ruled out completely (Egorova et al., 2018; Reinhold et al., 2019), there is no INDICation of such changes having happened over the last 9 kyr.

AR6_WG1_2_4,2,14,"et al., 2019). The compilation of Foster et al. (2017) constrained CO concentration to between 290 and 450 ppm during the MPWP, based primarily on the boron-isotope data reported by Martínez- Botí et al. (2015b), consistent with the AR5 range of 300–450 ppm. A more recent high-resolution boron isotope-based study revealed that CO cycled during the MPWP from about 330 to about 390 ppm on orbital timescales, with a mean of about 370 ppm (de la Vega et al., 2020). Although data from other proxy types (e.g., stomatal δ density or 13 C of alkenones) have too low resolution to resolve the orbital-related variability of CO during this interval (e.g., Kürschner et al., 1996; Stoll et al., 2019) there is general agreement among the different proxy types with the boron-derived mean (e.g., Stoll et al., 2019). High-resolution sampling (about 1 sample per 3 kyr) with the boron-isotope proxy INDICates mean CO mixing ratios for the Marine Isotope Stage KM5c interglacial were 360–420 ppm (medium confidence) (de la Vega et al., 2020). Following the MPWP, the atmospheric CO mixing ratio generally decreased at a rate of about 30 ppm Myr –1 . It is very likely that CO levels as high as the present were not experienced in the last 2 Myr (Hönisch et al., 2009; Bartoli et al., 2011; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Chalk et al., 2017; Dyez et al., 2018; Da et al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2019). Related to the shift of glacial-interglacial cycle frequency from 40 to 100 kyr at 0.8–1.2 Ma, there was a decrease of glacial-period CO (Chalk et al., 2017; Dyez et al., 2018). These boron isotope-based CO results agree with available records based on ancient ice exposed near the surface of the AIS (Yan et al., 2019), however, direct comparison is limited due to a lack of ancient ice cores with sufficiently continuous stratigraphy (Higgins et al., 2015; Brook and Buizert, 2018). To conclude, there is high confidence that average EECO and MPWP (KM5c) CO concentrations were higher than those preceding industrialization at 1150–2500 ppm and 360–420 ppm, respectively. Although there is some uncertainty due to the non-continuous nature of marine sediment records, the last time atmospheric CO mixing ratio was as high as present was very likely more than 2 Ma."

The global lifetimes of several ozone-depleting substances have been updated (SPARC, 2013), in particular for CFC-11 from 45 to 52 years."
AR6_WG1_2_6,2,19,"Since AR5, bias-adjusted spatially comprehensive SWV measurements by different satellite sensors were merged to form continuous records (Hegglin et al., 2014; Froidevaux et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2016). These INDICate no net global increase of SWV in the lower stratosphere since the late 1980s. Hegglin et al. (2014) reported a latitudinal dependence of SWV trends and suggested that the upward trend over Boulder should not be considered representative of the global stratosphere, while Lossow et al. (2018) showed insignificant differences between SWV trends at Boulder and those for the 35–45°N zonal mean from 1980 to 2010 using model simulations and satellite observations."
AR6_WG1_2_7,2,19,"In summary, in situ measurements at a single mid-latitude location INDICate about a 25% net increase in stratospheric water vapour since 1980, while merged satellite data records since the late 1980s suggest little net change. Recent studies of dynamical influences on SWV have highlighted their substantial roles in driving large interannual variability that complicates trend detection. There thus continues to be low confidence in trends of SWV over the instrumental period. Disregarding dynamic influences on SWV, an ERF of 0.05 ± 0.05 W m –2 is estimated for SWV produced by CH oxidation (Section 7.3.2.6), unchanged from AR5."
AR6_WG1_2_8,2,21,"Prior to 1850 ozone observations do not exist, but a recent analysis using clumped-isotope composition of molecular oxygen ( 18 O 18 O in O ) trapped in polar firn and ice, combined with atmospheric chemistry model simulations, constrains the global tropospheric ozone increase to less than 40% between 1850 and 2005, with most of this increase occurring between 1950 and 1980 (Yeung et al., 2019). Recently, the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report identified and evaluated 60 records of surface ozone observations collected at rural locations worldwide between 1896 and 1975, which were based on a range of measurement techniques with potentially large uncertainties (Tarasick et al., 2019). They found that from the mid-20th century (1930s to the early 1970s) to 1990–2014, rural surface ozone increased by 30–70% across the northern extra-tropics. This is smaller than the 100% 20th-century increase reported in AR5, which relied on far fewer measurement sites, all in Europe. In the northern tropics limited low-elevation historical data (1954–1975) provide no clear INDICation of surface ozone increases (Tarasick et al., 2019). However, similar to the northern mid-latitude increases, lower-free tropospheric ozone at Mauna Loa, Hawaii increased by approximately 50% from the late 1950s to present (Cooper et al., 2020). Historical observations are too limited to draw conclusions on surface ozone trends in"
AR6_WG1_2_9,2,21,"The earliest observations of free tropospheric ozone (1934–1955) are available from northern mid-latitudes where limited data INDICate a tropospheric column ozone increase of 48 ± 30% up to 1990–2012 (Tarasick et al., 2019). Starting in the 1960s, records from ozonesondes show no significant changes in the free troposphere over the Arctic and mid-latitude regions of Canada, but trends are mainly positive elsewhere in the northern mid-latitudes (Oltmans et al., 2013; Cooper et al., 2020). Tropospheric column and free tropospheric trends since the mid-1990s based on commercial aircraft, ozonesonde observations and satellite retrievals (Figure 2.8b,c), are overwhelmingly positive across the northern mid-latitudes (2–7%; 1–4 ppbv per decade) and tropics (2–14%; 1–5 ppbv per decade), with the largest increases (8–14%; 3–6 ppbv per decade) in the northern tropics in the vicinity of southern Asia and Indonesia. Observations in the SH are limited, but INDICate average tropospheric column ozone increases of 2–12% (1–5 ppbv) per decade in the tropics (Figure 2.8c), and weak tropospheric column ozone increases (<5%, <1 ppbv per decade) at mid-latitudes (Cooper et al., 2020). Above Antarctica, mid-tropospheric ozone has increased since the late 20th century (Oltmans et al., 2013). The total ozone ERF from 1750 to 2019 best estimate is assessed as 0.47 W m –2 (Section 7.3.2.5) and this is dominated by increases in the troposphere. The underlying modelled global tropospheric ozone column increase (Skeie et al., 2020) from 1850 to 2010 of 40–60%, is somewhat higher than the isotope based upper-limit of Yeung et al. (2019). At mid-latitudes (30°–60°N) model increases of 30–40% since the mid-20th century are broadly consistent with observations."
AR6_WG1_2_10,2,21,"In summary, limited available isotopic evidence constrains the global tropospheric ozone increase to less than 40% between 1850 and 2005 (low confidence). Based on sparse historical surface/low altitude data tropospheric ozone has increased since the mid-20th century by 30–70% across the NH (medium confidence). Surface/low altitude ozone trends since the mid-1990s are variable at northern mid-latitudes, but positive in the tropics [2 to 17% per decade] (high confidence). Since the mid-1990s, free tropospheric ozone has increased by 2–7% per decade in most regions of the northern mid-latitudes, and 2–12% per decade in the sampled regions of the northern and southern tropics (high confidence). Limited coverage by surface observations precludes identification of zonal trends in the SH, while observations of tropospheric column ozone INDICate increases of less than 5% per decade at southern mid-latitudes (medium confidence)."

Estimates of the glacial/interglacial ratio in global dust deposition are within the range of 2–4 (Albani et al., 2015; Lambert et al., 2015). New reconstructions INDICate a ratio of 3–5 for the glacial/interglacial troposphere (c) Tropospheric column average loadings for mid- and high-latitude ocean of both hemispheres (Lamy et al., 2014; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014; Serno et al., 2015). Improved quantification of changes in dust deposition from North Africa and North Atlantic sediment records confirms dust deposition rates lower by a factor 2–5 during the African Humid Period (10–5 ka) compared to the late Holocene (McGee et al., 2013; Albani et al., 2015; Middleton et al., 2018; Palchan and Torfstein, 2019). During the Holocene, biogenic emissions and volcanic activity drove significant variability (up to one order of magnitude) in sulphate concentrations (Schüpbach et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_2_12,2,24,"To conclude, atmospheric aerosols sampled by ice cores, influenced by northern mid-latitude emissions, show positive trends from 1700 until the last quarter of the 20th century and decreases thereafter (high confidence), but there is low confidence in observations of systematic changes in other parts of the world in these periods. Satellite data and ground-based records INDICate that AOD exhibits predominantly negative trends since 2000 over NH mid-latitudes and SH continents, but increased over South Asia and East Africa (high confidence). A globally deceasing aerosol abundance is thus assessed with medium confidence. This implies increasing net positive ERF, since the overall negative aerosol ERF has become smaller. 2.2.7 Land Use and Land Cover"
AR6_WG1_2_13,2,24,"Much of the global land surface has been modified or managed to some extent by human activities during the Holocene. Reconstructions based on pollen data INDICate that natural vegetation probably covered most of the Earth’s ice-free terrestrial surface until roughly the mid-Holocene (Marquer et al., 2017; Harrison et al., 2020; F. Li et al., 2020). Reconstructions based on pollen, archaeological, and historical data INDICate deforestation at the regional scale since at least 6 ka (Marquer et al., 2017; Stephens et al., 2019; Harrison et al., 2020; F. Li et al., 2020). From a global perspective, land-use forcing datasets (Lawrence et al., 2016) estimate that changes in land use (and related deforestation) were small on the global scale until the mid-19th century and accelerated markedly thereafter, with larger uncertainties prior to industrialization (Kaplan et al., 2017). Since the early 1980s, about 60% of all land cover changes have been associated with direct human activities, with spatial patterns emphasizing the regional character of land use and land management, including tropical deforestation, temperate afforestation, cropland intensification, and increased urbanization (Song et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2018). At present, nearly three-quarters of the ice-free terrestrial surface is under some form of human use (Venter et al., 2016; Erb et al., 2017), particularly in agriculture and forest management."

AR6_WG1_2_26,2,29,"For the LIG (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1, and Figure 2.11), a major new compilation of marine proxy data (Turney et al., 2020) from 203 sites INDICates that the average SST from 129–125 ka was 1.0°C ± 0.2°C (2 SD) warmer than 1850–1900 (reported relative to 1981–2010 and adjusted here by 0.8°C). These temperatures represent the time of peak warmth, which may not have been synchronous among these sites. This compares with two other SST estimates for 125 ka of 0.5°C ± 0.3°C (± 2 SD) warmer at 125 ka relative to 1870–1889 (Hoffman et al., 2017), and about 1.4°C (no uncertainty stated) warmer at 125 ka relative to 1850–1900 (Friedrich and Timmermann, 2020; reported relative to 10–5 ka and adjusted here by 0.4°C; Kaufman et al., 2020a). The average of these post-AR5 global SST anomalies is 1°C. Commensurately (Figure 3.2b), GMST is estimated to have been roughly 1.1°C above 1850–1900 values, although this value could be too high if peak warmth was not globally synchronous (Capron et al., 2017). A further estimate of peak GMST anomalies of 1.0°C–3.5°C (90% range; adjusted here to 1850–1900 by adding 0.2°C) based on 59 marine sediment cores (Snyder, 2016) is considerably warmer than remaining estimates and is therefore given less weight in the final assessment. The warmest millennium of the LIG GMST reconstruction in J. Hansen et al. (2013) is 1.5°C above 1850–1900. In summary, GMST during the warmest millennia of the LIG (within the interval of around 129–125 ka) is estimated to have reached 0.5°C–1.5°C higher values than the 1850–1990 reference period (medium confidence)."

Whereas SR1.5 focussed upon the ‘Holocene thermal maximum’ when regional temperatures were up to 1°C higher than 1850–1900, though peak warming occurred regionally at different times between around 10 and 5 ka greatly complicating interpretation. A multi-method reconstruction (Kaufman et al., 2020a) based on a quality-controlled, multi-proxy synthesis of paleo-temperature records from 470 terrestrial and 209 marine sites globally (Kaufman et al., 2020b) INDICates that the median GMST of the warmest two-century-long interval was 0.7 [0.3 to 1.8] °C warmer than 1800–1900 (which averaged 0.03°C colder than 1850–1900; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019), and was centred around 6.5 ka. This is similar to Marcott et al. (2013), which is based on a smaller dataset (73 sites) and different procedures to estimate a maximum warmth of 0.8°C ± 0.3°C (2 SD) at around 7.0 ka, adjusted here by adding 0.3°C to account for differences in reference periods. These may be"
AR6_WG1_2_29,2,31,"underestimates because averaging inherently smoothed proxy records with uncertain chronologies reduces the variability in the temperature reconstruction (e.g., Dolman and Laepple, (2018) for sedimentary archives). However, the general coincidence between peak warmth and astronomically driven boreal summer insolation might reflect a bias toward summer conditions (Liu et al., 2014; Hou et al., 2019; Bova et al., 2021), suggesting that the estimate is too high. This possibility is supported by AR5-generation proxy data focusing on 6 ka (Harrison et al., 2014), the long-standing MH modelling target (Cross- Chapter Box 2.1), that INDICate surface temperatures for land and ocean were indistinguishable from ‘pre-industrial’ climate (Figure 1c in Harrison et al., 2015; Figure 7 in Harrison et al., 2016).

AR6_WG1_2_30,2,31,"Taking all lines of evidence into account, the GMST averaged over the warmest centuries of the current interglacial period (sometime between around 6 and 7 ka) is estimated to have been 0.2°C–1.0°C higher than 1850–1900 (medium confidence). It is therefore more likely than not that no multi-centennial interval during the post- glacial period was warmer globally than the most recent decade (which was 1.1°C warmer than 1850–1900; Section 2.3.1.1.3); the LIG (129–116 ka) is the next most recent candidate for a period of higher global temperature. Zonally averaged mean annual temperature reconstructions (Routson et al., 2019) INDICate that MH warmth was most pronounced north of 30°N latitude, and that GMST subsequently decreased in general, albeit with multi-century variability, with greater cooling in the NH than in the SH (Kaufman et al., 2020a)."
AR6_WG1_2_31,2,31,"proxy data syntheses (Lüning et al., 2019a, b) have been published, extending back 1–2 kyr. In addition, a major new global compilation of multiproxy, annually resolved paleo-temperature records for the CE (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2017) has been analysed using a variety of statistical methods for reconstructing temperature (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019). The median of the multi-method GMST reconstruction from this synthesis (Figure 2.11a) generally agrees with the AR5 assessment, while affording more robust estimates of the following major features of GMST during the CE: (i) an overall millennial-scale cooling trend of –0.18 [–0.28 to 0.00] °C kyr –1 prior to 1850; (ii) a multi-centennial period of relatively low temperature beginning around the 15th century, with GMST averaging –0.03 [–0.30 to 0.06] °C between 1450 and 1850 relative to 1850–1900; (iii) the warmest multi-decadal period occurring most recently; and (iv) the rate of warming during the second half of the 20th century (from instrumental data) exceeding the 99th percentile of all 51-year trends over the past 2 kyr. Moreover, the new proxy data compilation shows that the warming of the 20th century was more spatially uniform than any other century-scale temperature change of the CE (medium confidence) (Neukom et al., 2019). A new independent temperature reconstruction extending back to 1580 is based on an expanded database of subsurface borehole temperature profiles, along with refined methods for inverse modelling (Cuesta-Valero et al., 2021). The borehole data, converted to GMST based on the modelled relation between changes in land versus sea surface temperature outlined previously, INDICate that average GMST for 1600–1650 was 0.12°C colder than 1850–1900, which is similar to the PAGES 2k reconstruction (0.09°C colder), although both estimates are associated with relatively large uncertainties (0.8°C (95% range) and 0.5°C (90% range), respectively)."

A number of recent studies also corroborate important components of the SST record (Hausfather et al., 2017; Kent et al., 2017; Cowtan et al., 2018; Kennedy et al., 2019). In particular, ATSR SST satellite retrievals (Merchant et al., 2012; Berry et al., 2018), the near-surface records from hydrographical profiles (Gouretski et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2018), and coastal observations (Cowtan et al., 2018) have all been shown to be broadly consistent with the homogenized SST analyses. Hausfather et al. (2017) also confirmed the new estimate of the rate of warming seen in ERSSTv4 since the late 1990s through comparison with independent SST data sources such as Argo floats and satellite retrievals. Nevertheless, dataset differences remain in the mid-20th century when there were major, poorly-documented, changes in instrumentation and observational practices (Kent et al., 2017), particularly during World War II, when ship observations were limited and disproportionately originated from US naval sources (Thompson et al., 2008). Kennedy et al. (2019) also identify differences between the new HadSST4 dataset and other SST datasets in the 1980s and 1990s, INDICating that some level of structural uncertainty remains during this period, whilst Chan et al.

The paleoclimate evidence assessed in AR5 was broadly consistent with global hydroclimate scaling with temperature: warmer periods were wetter (e.g., the Pliocene; increased precipitation) with colder periods being drier (e.g., the LGM; decreased precipitation)."
AR6_WG1_2_37,2,43,"Substantial limitations exist in reconstructing the global hydrological cycle prior to the Quaternary, particularly during the Eocene, due to the lack of high-resolution proxy records and their sparsity. Spatial heterogeneity complicates identification of wetting and drying signals during the PETM and the EECO, with paleo data and model simulations suggesting an intensified global hydrological cycle (Carmichael et al., 2016, 2017; Hyland et al., 2017; West et al., 2020), in particular an increased specific humidity (Winnick et al., 2015; van Dijk et al., 2020). Conditions wetter than present were inferred for the MPWP (Cross Chapter Box 2.4), with intensified Asian monsoons (An et al., 2015) but with nevertheless drier conditions over tropical and subtropical SH locations (Pontes et al., 2020). A new global reconstruction of hydroclimate proxies for the LIG points to stronger boreal precipitation compared to 1850–1900 over high latitudes and especially over monsoon areas, with a more heterogeneous signal for the SH (Scussolini et al., 2019). This heterogeneity is also present in the tropics, characterized by large zonal differences in precipitation change due to the variations in the intensity of Walker circulation (Section 2.3.1.4.1). Available records INDICate reduced global vegetation cover and abundant atmospheric dust deposition during the LGM (increased aridity), particularly over the tropics and high latitudes (Lamy et al., 2014; Újvári et al., 2017). This agrees with models and moisture-sensitive proxies, suggesting an overall decrease in global precipitation during the LGM relative to recent decades, albeit with regional-scale heterogeneity (Cao et al., 2019). Despite lower global precipitation amounts, research since AR5 has identified a wetting of mid-latitudes during the LGM (Putnam and Broecker, 2017; Lowry and Morrill, 2018; Morrill et al., 2018), thereby complicating the characterization of the LGM as a relatively ‘dry’ period. Low evaporation rates and increased top-soil moisture during the LGM may have contributed to elevated levels of large closed- basin lakes located in the 30°–45° latitudinal belts (Putnam and Broecker, 2017; Scheff et al., 2017), such as the south-west United States (e.g., Ibarra et al., 2018), southern Australia (Petherick et al., 2013; Fitzsimmons et al., 2015; Sniderman et al., 2019) and Patagonia (e.g., Quade and Kaplan, 2017)."
AR6_WG1_2_38,2,44,"To summarize, since AR5 there has been considerable progress in detecting the variations of the global hydrological cycle prior to the instrumental period. There are INDICations from multiple sources of a wetting trend during the Holocene, particularly for the NH and parts of the SH tropics (medium confidence). Hydroclimate during the CE is dominated by regional variability, generally precluding definitive statements on changes at continental and larger scales, with a general reduction of mega-drought occurrences over the last about 500 years (medium confidence). Availability of proxy data for assessing Holocene hydroclimate variability is biased towards the NH, with medium evidence but low agreement for the assessment of SH changes."
AR6_WG1_2_39,2,44,"Records prior to the instigation of quasi-global coverage by radiosondes require the use of statistical relationships to infer TCWV from historical SST observations or the evaluation of centennial-scale reanalysis products (Smith and Arkin, 2015). These approaches reveal two periods of positive trends, one from 1910 to 1940 and the other from 1975 onwards (Zhang et al., 2013; Mieruch et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2018), concurrent with periods of positive SST trends (Figure 2.11). Potential sources of errors in the SST-based estimation of TCWV include both uncertainties in historical SST and uncertainties in the parameters that define the relationship between the variables (Smith and Arkin, 2015). Trends based on 20CRv2c, ERA-20C and ERA-20CM INDICate an increase in TCWV over much of the global ocean since the beginning of the 20th century, particularly over the tropics (Bordi et al., 2015; Smith and Arkin, 2015; Poli et al., 2016). TCWV trends"
AR6_WG1_2_40,2,46,"In situ precipitation records over land extend back for centuries in a few locations, and to the early to mid-20th century quasi-globally. Datasets differ in their input data, completeness of records, period covered, and the gridding procedures applied, which, given spatial clustering and the small spatial scales of precipitation, results in differences in global and regional estimates of precipitation changes (Q. Sun et al., 2018; Nogueira, 2020). The spatial variability of observed long-term trends (1901–2019) based on GPCC V2020 and CRU TS 4.04 (Figure 2.15a,b) INDICates significant increases in precipitation mainly over eastern North America, northern Eurasia, southern South America and north-western Australia. Decreases are strongest across tropical western and equatorial Africa and southern Asia. The temporal evolution of global annual land precipitation anomalies exhibits little consistency between GPCC V2020, CRU TS 4.04 and GHCNv4 datasets, especially prior to 1950, that is associated with limitations in data coverage (Figure 2.15c; Wu et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014; Gu and Adler, 2015). These disagreements between datasets prior to the 1950s result in differences in trend estimates over global land (Table 2.6). A qualitative consistency in decadal and interdecadal variations between the products is only observed since the 1950s, with primarily positive land precipitation anomalies during the 1950s, 1970s and during 2000 to 2019 (Figure 2.15c)."

However, AR5 INDICated a likely widening of the tropical belt since the 1970s, albeit with large uncertainty in the magnitude of this change. There was high confidence that the post-1990s strengthening of the Pacific WC reversed its weakening observed from the mid-19th century to the 1990s."
AR6_WG1_2_43,2,50,"Since AR5 several studies based upon a range of metrics and different reanalyses products have suggested that the annual mean HC extent has shifted poleward at an approximate rate of 0.1°–0.5° latitude per decade over the last about 40 years (Allen and Kovilakam, 2017; Davis and Birner, 2017; Grise et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018, 2020; Studholme and Gulev, 2018; Grise and Davis, 2020). The observed widening of the annual mean HC, revealed by a variety of metrics, is primarily due to poleward shift of the Northern Hemisphere HC. There have been stronger upward trends in the NH extent of HC after 1992 (Figure 2.17a). The estimated magnitude of the recent changes based on modern-era reanalyses is not as large as that in AR5, due to apparent biases in older-generation reanalyses (Grise et al., 2019). Moreover, large interannual variability leads to uncertainties in estimates of long- term changes (Nguyen et al., 2013; Garfinkel et al., 2015b; Seviour et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018), particularly for the NH given its zonal asymmetries (Staten et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). These large-scale features of the HC based on reanalyses agree with estimates revealed from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) during 1979–2012 (Lucas and Nguyen, 2015; Mathew et al., 2016). Recent trends based on reanalyses INDICate a larger seasonal widening in the HC for summer and autumn in each hemisphere, although the magnitude of changes in HC extent is strongly dependent on dataset and metrics used (Grise et al., 2018; Y. Hu et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018). The shifts in the HC position were accompanied by a narrowing ITCZ over the Atlantic and Pacific basins, with no significant change in its location and increases in the precipitation intensity (Byrne et al., 2018)."

During the Holocene, a transition from a strong WC located more westward during the Early-to-Mid Holocene towards a weak and eastward shifted WC during the late Holocene was inferred from proxy records from the Pacific Warm Pool and South East Asia (Barr et al., 2019; Dang et al., 2020; Griffiths et al., 2020), in concurrence with changes in ENSO activity (Section 2.4.2). Reconstructions for the CE showed weakened WC during 1000–1250 and since 1850, with an intensified circulation during 1500–1850 CE (Xu et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017)."

Based on estimation of changes in mid-tropospheric velocity from changes in observed cloud cover, Bellomo and Clement (2015) suggest a weakening and eastward shift of the WC over 1920–2010, however the robustness of this signal is questionable due to high uncertainty in the ship-reported cloud data used before 1954. Using centennial-scale 20CR reanalysis Tseng et al. (2019) showed that the vertical westerly wind shear over the western Pacific does not INDICate any long-term change during 1900–1980, but shows a marked increase since the 1980s that is not present in ERA-Interim and JRA-55, again calling into question the ability of centennial- scale reanalyses to capture tropical circulation changes. Recent strengthening together with a westward shift of the WC (Bayr et al., 2014; Ma and Zhou, 2016) was identified across several reanalysis products and observational datasets, and using different metrics for quantifying WC. Nevertheless, satellite observations of precipitation and analyses of upper tropospheric humidity suggest substantially weaker strengthening of the WC than implied by reanalyses (Chung et al., 2019). This recent strengthening in the WC is associated with enhanced precipitation in the tropical western Pacific, anomalous westerlies in the upper troposphere, strengthened downwelling in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and anomalous surface easterlies in the western and central tropical Pacific (Dong and Lu, 2013; McGregor et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016). Positive trends in sea level pressure over the eastern Pacific and concurrent negative trends over the Indonesian region result in a pattern implying a shift towards a La Niña-like WC regime, with strengthening of the Pacific Trade Winds mainly over 1979–2012 (L’Heureux et al., 2013; England et al., 2014; Sohn et al., 2016; Zhao and Allen, 2019). Seasonal assessment of the WC showed significant changes in the vertical westerly wind shear over the Pacific during the austral summer and autumn implying a strengthening (Clem et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_2_46,2,51,"An intensification of the NH monsoons in the early to mid-Holocene with increased precipitation and regional expansions of rainfall areas identified through a variety of proxy records is shown by Biasutti et al.

Wang et al., 2014, 2017; Sachs et al., 2018). A decline in GM precipitation and a retraction of the northern fringes of monsoon areas was inferred from the mid-Holocene onwards, with some regions experiencing wetter conditions during the mid to late Holocene compared with present and a strengthening of the SH monsoons (P.X. Wang et al., 2014, 2017; Sachs et al., 2018). For the CE, GM reconstructions exhibit inter-hemispheric contrast during the period 950–1250 CE, with intensified NH monsoons and weakened SH monsoons, and the opposite pattern during 1400–1850 CE (P.X.

AR6_WG1_2_48,2,52,"The AR5 reported a likely poleward shift of storm tracks and jet streams since the 1970s from different datasets, variables and approaches. These trends were consistent with the HC widening and the poleward shifting of the circulation features since the 1970s. There was low confidence in any large-scale change in blocking. Proxy records consistent with modelling results imply a southward shift of the storm tracks over the North Atlantic during the LGM (Raible et al., 2021). A variety of proxies are available for the changes in the position of the extratropical jets/westerlies during the Holocene. Recent syntheses of moisture-sensitive proxy records INDICate drier-than-present conditions over mid-latitudes of western North America (Hermann et al., 2018; Liefert and Shuman, 2020) during the MH, which together with a weakened Aleutian Low (Bailey et al., 2018) implies that the winter North Pacific jetstream was shifted northward. A synthesis of lines of evidence from the SH INDICates that the westerly winds were stronger over 14–5 ka, followed by regional asymmetry after 5 ka (Fletcher and Moreno, 2012). There is no consensus on the shifts of the SH westerlies with some studies implying poleward migrations (Lamy et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2015; Turney et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018) and others suggesting an equatorward shift (Kaplan et al., 2016) in the MH."

Storm tracks over the North Atlantic-European sector shifted northward as INDICated by multi-proxy INDICATORs over the North Atlantic (Wirth et al., 2013; Orme et al., 2017) and Mediterranean (Roberts et al., 2012). Reconstructed westerly winds in the SH suggest a poleward shift (Lamy et al., 2010; Schimpf et al., 2011; Goodwin et al., 2014; Koffman et al., 2014; Moreno et al., 2018), with latitudinal change comparable to that during recent decades (Swart and Fyfe, 2012; Manney and Hegglin, 2018)."
AR6_WG1_2_50,2,52,"Multiple reanalyses show that since 1979 the subtropical jet wind speeds have generally increased in winter and decreased in summer in both hemispheres, but the trends are regionally dependent (Pena-Ortiz et al., 2013; Manney and Hegglin, 2018; S.H. Lee et al., 2019). Over NH mid-latitudes, the summer zonal wind speeds have weakened in the mid-troposphere (Francis and Vavrus, 2012; Coumou et al., 2014, 2015; Haimberger and Mayer, 2017). Meanwhile there are INDICations of enhanced jetstream meandering in boreal autumn at the hemispheric scale (Francis and Vavrus, 2015; Di Capua and Coumou, 2016), whereas the regional arrangement of meandering depends on the background atmospheric state (Cohen et al., 2020). These meandering trends, however, are sensitive to the metrics used (Screen and Simmonds, 2013; Hassanzadeh et al., 2014;"
AR6_WG1_2_51,2,56,"Over the past two decades, first-year sea ice has become more dominant and the oldest multiyear ice (older than 4 years) which in March 1985 made up 33% of the Arctic sea-ice cover, has nearly disappeared, making up 1.2% in March 2019 (Perovich et al., 2020). The loss of older ice is INDICative of a thinning overall of ice cover (Tschudi et al., 2016), but also the remaining older ice has become thinner (E. Hansen et al., 2013). Since in situ ice thickness measurements are sparse, information about ice thickness is mainly based on airborne and satellite surveys. Records from a combination"
AR6_WG1_2_52,2,57,"of different platforms show for the central and western Arctic Ocean (Arctic Ocean north of Canada and Alaska) negative trends since the mid-1970s (Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015; Kwok, 2018), with a particularly rapid decline during the 2000s, which coincided with a large loss of multiyear sea ice. Direct observations from 2004 and 2017 INDICate a decrease of modal ice thickness in the Arctic Ocean north of Greenland by 0.75 m, but with little thinning between 2014 and 2017 (Haas et al., 2017). This agrees with data based on satellite altimetry and airborne observations, showing no discernible thickness trend since 2010 (Kwok and Cunningham, 2015; Kwok, 2018; Kwok and Kacimi, 2018; see Figure 2.21). However, sea-ice thickness derived from airborne and spaceborne data is still subject to uncertainties imposed by snow loading. For radar altimeters, insufficient penetration of radar signal into the snowpack results in overestimation of ice thickness (e.g., Ricker et al., 2015; King et al., 2018; Nandan et al., 2020). Negative trends in ice thickness since the 1990s are also reported from the Fram Strait in the Greenland Sea, and north of Svalbard (E. Hansen et al., 2013; Renner et al., 2014; King et al., 2018; Rösel et al., 2018; Spreen et al., 2020). Thickness data collected in the Fram Strait originate from ice exported from the interior of the Arctic Basin and are representative of a larger geographical area upstream in the transpolar drift. A reduction of survival rates of sea ice exported from the Siberian shelves by 15% per decade has interrupted the transpolar drift and affected the long- range transport of sea ice (Krumpen et al., 2019). The thinner and on average younger ice has less resistance to dynamic forcing, resulting in a more dynamic ice cover (Hakkinen et al., 2008; Spreen et al., 2011; Vihma et al., 2012; Kwok et al., 2013). Changes in Arctic sea ice thickness The SROCC noted the lack of continuous records of snow on sea ice. Nevertheless in recent decades, more snow on sea ice has been observed in the Atlantic sector in the Arctic than in the western Arctic Ocean (Webster et al., 2018). Previously, Warren et al. (1999) showed that over 1954–1991 there were weak trends towards declining snow depth on sea ice in the Pacific sector. Recent observations INDICate a substantial thinning of the spring snowpack in the western Arctic (Cavalieri et al., 2012; Brucker and Markus, 2013; Kurtz et al., 2013; Laxon et al., 2013; Webster et al., 2018). In contrast, thick snow over Arctic sea ice in the Atlantic sector north of Svalbard (snow thickness around 0.4 m or more) has been observed in the 1970s and since the 1990s (Rösel et al., 2018), but data are too sparse to detect trends."
AR6_WG1_2_53,2,57,"In summary, over 1979–2019 Arctic SIA has decreased for all months, with the strongest decrease in summer (very high confidence). Decadal means for SIA decreased from the first to the last decade in that period from 6.23 to 3.76 million km 2 for September, and from 14.52 to 13.42 million km 2 for March. Arctic sea ice has become younger, thinner and faster moving (very high confidence). Snow thickness on sea ice has decreased in the western Arctic Ocean (medium confidence). Since the Younger Dryas at the end of the LDT, proxy INDICATORs show that Arctic sea ice has fluctuated on multiple time scales with a decrease in sea ice coverage during the Early Holocene and an increase from the MH to the mid-15th century. Current pan-Arctic sea ice coverage levels (annual mean and late summer) are unprecedentedly low since 1850 (high confidence), and with medium confidence for late summer for at least the past 1 kyr."

The SROCC noted that a significant positive trend in mean annual sea ice cover between 1979 and 2015 had not persisted, due to three consecutive years of below-average sea ice cover (2016–2018). The SROCC stated also that historical Antarctic sea ice data from different sources INDICated a decrease in overall Antarctic sea ice cover since the early 1960s, but was too small to be separated from natural variability (high confidence)."
AR6_WG1_2_55,2,57,"There is only limited evidence from predominantly regional paleo proxies for the evolution of Southern Ocean sea ice before the instrumental record and estimates are not available for all proxy target periods (Section 9.3.2). Proxies from marine sediments for intervals preceding and following the MPWP INDICate open water conditions with less sea ice than modern conditions (Taylor-Silva and Riesselman, 2018; Ishino and Suto, 2020). During the LGM, proxies INDICate that austral winter sea ice coverage reached the polar ocean front (e.g., Nair et al., 2019). More recently, sea ice coverage appears to have fluctuated substantially throughout the Holocene (e.g., for the western Amundsen Sea, Lamping et al., 2020). At the beginning of the CE, regional summer sea ice coverage in the north-western Ross Sea was lower than today (Tesi et al., 2020). Crosta et al.

More recent sea ice reconstructions are based on diverse sources including whaling records (de La Mare, 1997, 2009; Cotté and Guinet, 2007), old ship logbooks (Ackley et al., 2003; Edinburgh and Day, 2016), and ice core records (Curran et al., 2003; Abram et al., 2010; Sinclair et al., 2014), amongst other methods (e.g., Murphy et al., 2014). These reconstructions, in combination with recent satellite- based observations INDICate: (i) a decrease in summer SIE across all Antarctic sectors since the early- to mid-20th century; (ii) a decrease in winter SIE in the East Antarctic and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas sectors starting in the 1960s; and (iii) small fluctuations in winter SIE in the Weddell Sea over the 20th century (Hobbs et al., 2016a, b). There are also ice-core INDICations that the pronounced Ross Sea increase dates back to the mid-1960s (Sinclair et al., 2014; Thomas and Abram, 2016). While there is reasonable broad-scale concurrence across these estimates, the uncertainties are large, there is considerable interannual variability, and reconstructions require further validation (Hobbs et al., 2016a, b). New reconstructions (Thomas et al., 2019) from Antarctic land ice cores show that SIE in the Ross Sea had increased between 1900 and 1990, while the Bellingshausen Sea had experienced a decline in SIE; this dipole pattern is consistent with satellite-based observations from 1979 to 2019 (Parkinson, 2019), but the recent rate of change then has been larger. Records of Antarctic SIE for the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Edinburgh and Day, 2016), show SIE comparable with the satellite era, although with marked spatial heterogeneity (e.g., Thomas et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_2_57,2,58,"Early Nimbus satellite visible and infrared imagery from the 1960s (Meier et al., 2013; Gallaher et al., 2014) INDICate higher overall SIE compared to 1979–2013 (Hobbs et al., 2016a, b), but with large uncertainties and poorly quantified biases (NA SEM, 2017). The continuous satellite passive-microwave record shows that there was a modest increase in overall Antarctic SIA of 2.5% ± 0.2% per decade (1 standard error over 1979–2015; Comiso et al., 2017). For overall ice coverage and for this period, positive long-term trends were most pronounced during austral autumn advance (Maksym, 2019), being moderate in summer and winter, and lowest in spring (Holland, 2014; Turner et al., 2015; Hobbs et al., 2016a, b; Comiso et al., 2017). Since 2014, overall Antarctic SIE (and SIA) has exhibited major fluctuations from record-high to record-low satellite era extents (Massonnet et al., 2015; Reid and Massom, 2015; Reid et al., 2015; Comiso et al., 2017; Parkinson, 2019). After setting record- high extents each September from 2012 through 2014, Antarctic SIE (and SIA) dipped rapidly in mid-2016 and remained predominantly below average through 2019 (Reid et al., 2020). For the most recent decade of observations (2010–2019), the decadal means of three SIA products (Figure 2.20b) were 2.17 million km 2 for February and 15.75 million km 2 for September, respectively. The corresponding levels for the means for the first decade of recordings (1979–1988) were 2.04 million km 2 for February and 15.39 million km 2 for September INDICating little overall change. Initial SIA data for 2020 (OSISAF) show SIA for September above, and for February slightly below the recent decadal means (Figure 2.20b). The 2020 September level (OSISAF) remains below the levels observed over 2012–2014. In summary, Antarctic sea ice has experienced both increases and decreases in SIA over 1979–2019, and substantively lower levels since 2016, with only minor differences between decadal means of SIA for the first (for February 2.04 million km 2 , for September 15.39 million km 2 ) and last decades (for February 2.17 million km 2 , for September 15.75 million km 2 ) of satellite observations (high confidence). There remains low confidence in all aspects of Antarctic sea ice prior to the satellite era owing to a paucity of records that are highly regional in nature and often seemingly contradictory."

The limited pre-satellite era data does not allow for a similar assessment for the entire spring-summer period. Assessment of SCE trends in the NH since 1978 INDICates that for the October to February period there is substantial uncertainty in trends with the sign dependent on the observational product. Analysis using the NOAA Climate Data Record shows an increase in October to February SCE (Hernández-Henríquez et al., 2015; Kunkel et al., 2016) while analyses based on satellite borne optical sensors (Hori et al., 2017) or multi-observation products (Mudryk et al., 2020) show a negative trend for all seasons (Section 9.5.3.1 and Figure 9.23). The greatest declines in SCE have occurred during boreal spring and summer, although the estimated magnitude is dataset dependent (Rupp et al., 2013; Estilow et al., 2015; Bokhorst et al., 2016; Thackeray et al., 2016; Connolly et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_2_59,2,59,"There has been a commensurate decrease in the snow-cover duration and persistence, particularly in higher latitudes due to earlier spring melt and, in some cases, later autumn onset of snow cover (Chen et al., 2015; Derksen et al., 2015; Hori et al., 2017; Hammond et al., 2018). Arctic snow-cover duration has decreased by 2–4 days per decade since the 1970s (Brown et al., 2017). Significant decreases in snow-cover duration have been documented over western Eurasia since 1978 (Hori et al., 2017). For the NH, maximum snow depth has generally decreased since the 1960s, with more robust trends for North America and greater uncertainty for Eurasia (Kunkel et al., 2016). Several satellite-based passive microwave and other products INDICate general declines in pre-melt snow water equivalent since 1981 although there is regional and inter-dataset variability (Brown et al., 2017; Jeong et al., 2017; Marty et al., 2017; Mortimer et al., 2020; Mudryk et al., 2020; Pulliainen et al., 2020, Section 9.5.3)."
AR6_WG1_2_60,2,59,"Two recent global reviews on glaciers over the Holocene (Solomina et al., 2015) and the past 2 kyr (Solomina et al., 2016) summarize the chronologies of respectively 189 and 275 glaciers. The former shows that glaciers retreated during the LDT and retracted to their minimum extent between 8 ka and 6 ka. Except for some glaciers in the SH and tropics, glaciers expanded thereafter, reaching their maximum extent beyond their present-day margins during the mid- 15th to late 19th centuries CE. With few exceptions, glacier margins worldwide have retreated since the 19th century, with the rate of retreat and its global character since the late 20th century being unusual in the context of the Holocene (Solomina et al., 2016, Figure 2.23a). However, the areal extents of modern glaciers in most places in the NH are still larger than those of the early and/or middle Holocene (Solomina et al., 2015). When considering Holocene and present glaciers extents, it is important to account for the relatively long adjustment time of glaciers (often referred to as response time; Section 9.5.1.3); the majority of modern glaciers are currently out of equilibrium with current climate, even without further global warming (Mernild et al., 2013; Christian et al., 2018; Marzeion et al., 2018; Zekollari et al., 2020). The size of glaciers during other periods warmer than the Early to Mid-Holocene, such as the MPWP and LIG, is largely unknown because the deposits marking previous extents were in almost all cases over-ridden by later glaciations. For Arctic glaciers, different regional studies consistently INDICate that in many places glaciers are now smaller than they have been in millennia (Lowell et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2013, 2017; Harning et al., 2016, 2018; Schweinsberg et al., 2017, 2018; Pendleton et al., 2019). annual mass change"

Observations between the 1960s and 2019 INDICate that mass loss has increased over recent decades (Figure 2.23b). The overall global glacier mass loss rate has increased from 240 ± 9 Gt yr –1 over 2000–2009 to 290 ± 10 Gt yr –1 over 2010–2019 (Hugonnet et al., 2021), confirming that the last decade exhibits the most negative glacier mass balance since the beginning of the observational record. Observations are in general consistent with trends revealed by global glacier mass change modelling for almost the entire 20th century (1901–1990) implying an estimated mass loss (without uncharted glaciers (Parkes and Marzeion, 2018) and excluding peripheral glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica) of very likely 210 ± 90 Gt yr –1 and very likely 170 ± 80 Gt yr –1 for the period 1971–2019 (Marzeion et al., 2015; Section 9.5.1 and Table 9.5)."
AR6_WG1_2_62,2,60,"Details of the history of the GrIS fluctuations during warm interglacials continue to be elucidated. Oscillations over the past 7.5 Myr, including the Pliocene and through the glacial – interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene are not well-constrained, but most studies INDICate that Greenland was at least partially glaciated over this time with extended periods when it was predominantly deglaciated (Bierman et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 2016). Geological evidence and modelling studies suggest periods of glacial intensification during the Pliocene at 4.9 Myr, 4.0 Myr, 3.6 Myr and 3.3 Myr (De Schepper et al., 2014; Bierman et al., 2016; Bachem et al., 2017). Retreat of the GrIS occurred during the MPWP and GrIS extent was reduced compared to today with some studies suggesting that the ice sheet was limited to the highest elevations (De Schepper et al., 2014; Koenig et al., 2015; Haywood et al., 2016; Blake-Mizen et al., 2019). There is apparent glacial intensification following the MPWP, 2.75–2.72 Myr (Nielsen and Kuijpers, 2013; De Schepper et al., 2014; Blake-Mizen et al., 2019; Knutz et al., 2019). Several studies agree that during the LIG the total GrIS extent was likely less than present day (Section 9.4.1, Figure 9.17) with the total mass loss ranging from 0.3–6.2 m sea level equivalent (SLE), although timing and magnitude of this mass loss are not well constrained (Helsen et al., 2013; Stone et al., 2013; Vasskog et al., 2015; Goelzer et al., 2016; Sinclair et al., 2016; Yau et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2020). During the LGM, the GrIS reached a peak ice volume greater than present (2–5 m SLE), as revealed by the limited number of available geological records (Simpson et al., 2009; Lecavalier et al., 2014; Batchelor et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_2_63,2,60,"Greenland-wide estimates of mass change based on direct observations were limited prior to 1992 at the time of AR5 (Kjeldsen et al., 2015). Combined records based on airborne observations, model-based estimates and geodetic approaches INDICate an average mass loss of 75 ± 29.4 Gt yr –1 for 1900–1983 (Kjeldsen et al., 2015). Integration of proxies and modelling INDICates that the last time the rate of mass loss of the GrIS was plausibly similar to 20th century rates was during the early Holocene (Buizert et al., 2018; Briner et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_2_64,2,61,"Process understanding and, to some extent, paleoclimate records show that changes in parts of the AIS can occur over multi-century time scales (<2kyr; Sections 9.4.2.3 and 9.6.2; e.g., Dowdeswell et al., 2020). Based on physical understanding, paleo evidence and numerical simulations, it is very likely that the AIS has been smaller than today during at least some past warm climates (such as MCO and LIG), in particular the WAIS (Figure 9.18; Golledge et al., 2014; de Boer et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Levy et al., 2016). Results from sediment studies suggest a smaller AIS during the MPWP compared with current levels, with main differences in the WAIS (Section 9.6.2; SROCC, IPCC, 2019; Bertram et al., 2018; Shakun et al., 2018). Marine sediments INDICate that during the Pleistocene repeated ungrounding and loss of large marine-based parts of the AIS occurred during interglacial periods, with at least seven transitions between floating and grounded ice in the Ross Sea during the last 780 kyr (McKay et al., 2012) and at least three reductions in ice volume in the Wilkes Basin during the last 500 kyr (Wilson et al., 2018). Proxies, modelling and process understanding (Rohling et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020) INDICate that the AIS was smaller during the LIG than present."
AR6_WG1_2_65,2,61,"Geological evidence has been used to reconstruct Holocene glacial fluctuations of the ice sheet margin and lowerings of its surface, which occurred at different times in different places, as recently reviewed by Noble et al. (2020). In West Antarctica, marine sediments below the ice sheet (Kingslake et al., 2018) corroborate a previous glacial isostatic adjustment modelling study (Bradley et al., 2015), which suggests that ice had retreated behind the present grounding line prior to about 10 ka, and then readvanced. Geophysical imaging INDICates a readvance in this area around 6 ± 2 ka (Wearing and Kingslake, 2019). Other studies from the region conclude that ice- sheet retreat and thinning was fastest from 9 to 8 ka (Johnson et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2016; Spector et al., 2017), or millennia later, during the MH (Hein et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2019), with INDICations of a subsequent readvance (Venturelli et al., 2020). In East Antarctica, rapid ice-sheet thinning occurred between around 9 and 5 ka (Jones et al., 2015), consistent with previous work INDICating that the ice sheet in many regions was at or close to its current position by 5 ka (Bentley et al., 2014). Overall, during the MH, the AIS was retreating, but remained more extensive than present, while some parts of the ice sheet might have been smaller than now (low confidence)."
AR6_WG1_2_66,2,62,"Permafrost occurrence during the Pliocene has been inferred from pollen in lake sediments in NE Arctic Russia and permafrost-vegetation relationships which INDICate that permafrost was absent during the MPWP in this region (Brigham-Grette et al., 2013; Herzschuh et al., 2016). Analysis of speleothem records in Siberian caves, INDICates that permafrost was absent in the current continuous permafrost zone at 60°N at the start of the 1.5 Ma record, with aggradation occurring around 0.4 Ma (Vaks et al., 2020). There are INDICations of extensive permafrost thaw during subsequent interglacials especially further south in the current permafrost zone (Vaks et al., 2013). Reconstruction of permafrost distribution during the LGM INDICates that permafrost was more extensive in exposed areas (Vandenberghe et al., 2014). In non-glaciated areas of the North American Arctic there is permafrost that survived the LIG (French and Millar, 2014). Trends and timing of permafrost aggradation and thaw over the last 6 kyr in peatlands of the NH were recently summarized (Hiemstra, 2018; Treat and Jones, 2018). Three multi-century periods (ending 1000 Before the Common Era (BCE), 500 CE and 1850 CE) of permafrost aggradation, associated with neoglaciation periods are inferred resulting in more extensive permafrost in peatlands of the present-day discontinuous permafrost zone, which reached a peak approximately 250 years ago, with thawing occurring concurrently with post 1850 warming (Treat and Jones, 2018). Although permafrost persists in peatlands at the southern extent of the permafrost zone where it was absent prior to 3 ka, there has been thawing since the 1960s (James et al., 2013; B.M.

Ice cores imply a small decrease in the global mean ocean temperature during the early Holocene (<0.4°C) (Bereiter et al., 2018; Baggenstos et al., 2019). Sediment cores from the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Ocean (0–1000 m) INDICate a stronger regional cooling (compared to mean ocean temperature) of 1.0°C ± 0.7°C to 1.8°C ± 0.4°C from the early/ mid-Holocene to ca.1750 CE (Rosenthal et al., 2013, 2017; Morley et al., 2014; Kalansky et al., 2015). Sediment cores from the western equatorial Pacific suggest 0.8°C ± 0.1°C higher temperatures in the upper 700 m of the ocean during 950–1100 CE compared to 1400–1750 CE.

A combined study of model and observational data further confirmed these results, treating temperature as a passive tracer (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019) and addressing the role of circulation dynamics (Scheen and Stocker, 2020). Collectively, the proxy records INDICate a global OHC decrease of about 400 ± 70 ZJ (about 170 ± 100 ZJ in the Pacific) in the upper 700 m between 950–1100 CE and 1400–1750 CE, and also suggest that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to this cooling (Rosenthal et al., 2013), partially offsetting the global increase since 1750 CE (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019; Gebbie, 2021)."
AR6_WG1_2_72,2,64,"LEGOS Zanna et al. 2019 Desb17 Table 2.7 In summary, current multi-decadal to centennial rates of OHC gain are greater than at any point since the last deglaciation (medium confidence). At multi-centennial timescales, changes in OHC based upon proxy INDICATORs demonstrate a tight link with surface temperature changes during the last deglaciation (high confidence), as well as during the Holocene and CE (low confidence). It is likely the global ocean has warmed since 1871, consistent with the observed increase in sea surface temperature. It is virtually certain that OHC increased between 1971 and 2018 in the upper 700 m and very likely in the 700–2000 m layer, with high confidence since 2006. It is likely the OHC below 2000 m has increased since 1992. Confidence in the assessment of multi-decadal OHC increase is further strengthened by consistent closure of both global sea level and energy budgets (Section 7.2.2.2, Box 7.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9.1). m"
AR6_WG1_2_73,2,66,"Since AR5, new and extended multi-decadal analyses have strengthened the observational support for increased contrast between high and low near-surface salinity regions and inter-basin contrast since the mid-20th century (Section 9.2.2.2; Durack and Wijffels, 2010; Good et al., 2013; Skliris et al., 2014; Aretxabaleta et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2020). These analyses employ different statistical algorithms for interpolation, and only Cheng et al. (2020) use CMIP5 model simulations to constrain observation-based signals in data-sparse regions. The 1950–2019 trends reveal near-surface freshening of the northern and western Warm (and fresh) Pool of the Pacific and increased salinity maxima in the subtropical Atlantic, strengthening the inter- basin contrast (Figure 2.27a). There are INDICations that the subpolar freshening and subtropical salinification of the Atlantic ocean may extend back to at least 1896 (Friedman et al., 2017). Over recent decades, new observations from Argo floats and ocean reanalyses provide general support that changes in the global patterns of near- surface salinity contrast are broadly associated with an intensification of the hydrological cycle (Sections 2.3.1.3.5 and 8.3.1.1). However, this assessment is complicated by changing observational techniques (Section 1.5.1), temporally and spatially inhomogeneous sampling and uncertainties in interpolation algorithms and the substantial influence of modes of natural variabiltity and ocean circulation processes over interannual timescales (Skliris et al., 2014; Durack, 2015; Grist et al., 2016; Aretxabaleta et al., 2017; Vinogradova and Ponte, 2017; Liu et al., 2020). Following AR5, based on the updated analysis from Durack and Wijffels (2010) which infills in situ gaps to recover large-scale patterns the mean salinity contrast between high- and low- near-surface salinity regions increased by 0.14 [0.07 to 0.20] from 1950 to 2019."
AR6_WG1_2_74,2,67,"Few sites globally have well-preserved MIS 11 sea-level INDICATORs (Dutton et al., 2015). As reported in AR5, Raymo and Mitrovica (2012) used glacial isostatic adjustment models to correct the elevation of MIS 11 sea-level proxies from Bermuda and Bahamas to estimate a peak MIS 11 GMSL between 6 and 13 m above present-day. This agrees with the elevation of 13 ± 2 m for the MIS 11 subtidal–intertidal transition in South Africa (Roberts et al., 2012). A revised glacial isostatic adjustment at this location resulted in a peak GMSL estimate of 8–11.5 m (Chen et al., 2014). In light of these data, and the review by Dutton et al. (2015), the AR5 estimate of 6–13 m for MIS 11 remains the best available (medium confidence)."
AR6_WG1_2_75,2,67,"Recent studies have highlighted uncertainties in estimates of GMSL during the LIG, including the extent of GMSL variability (Capron et al., 2019). Vertical land motions (Austermann et al., 2017) are starting to be considered quantitatively (e.g., Stephenson et al., 2019), but are still bounded by large uncertainties. The distribution and thickness of pre-LIG ice sheets (Dendy et al., 2017; Rohling et al., 2017) and isostasy driven by sediment loading since the LIG (Pico, 2020) add further uncertainty. In light of these recent studies and previous assessments, there is medium confidence that peak GMSL during the LIG was likely between 5 and 10 m higher than modern. Relative sea-level estimates from some sites (e.g., Bahamas and Seychelles) report ephemeral, metre-scale fluctuations (Vyverberg et al., 2018). Different generations of LIG reef growth at other sites (e.g., Yucatan Peninsula, Western Australia) suggest the occurrence of sudden accelerations in GMSL change (Blanchon et al., 2009; O’Leary et al., 2013). However, other sites (e.g., South Australia, Mediterranean), INDICate that LIG sea level was substantially stable (T.-Y. Pan et al., 2018; Polyak et al., 2018). In addition, there are uncertainties in the interpretation of local relative sea level from some GMSL reconstructions (Barlow et al., 2018). Therefore, low confidence is assigned to any GMSL rate of change estimated within the LIG."
AR6_WG1_2_76,2,69,"On multi-millennial timescales, proxy evidence INDICates that the AMOC varied repeatedly in strength and vertical structure. During the last glacial period, particularly around the LGM, AMOC was estimated to be shallower than present, although there is continued debate about the magnitude of the shoaling (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; Gebbie, 2014), and whether this change was associated with a weaker overturning (Ritz et al., 2013; Menviel et al., 2017; Muglia et al., 2018). There are INDICations that substantial variations in AMOC were associated with abrupt climate changes during the glacial intervals, including Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events (14– 70 ka) (McManus et al., 2004; Böhm et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016; Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017). During these millennial-scale oscillations, weakened AMOC was associated with dramatic cooling in the NH and warming in the SH (Buizert et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016), while hemispheric changes of opposite sign accompanied strengthened AMOC. After the final demise of the Laurentide ice sheet about 8 ka, the mean overall strength of AMOC has been relatively stable throughout the rest of the Holocene compared to the preceding 100 kyr (Hoffmann et al., 2018; Lippold et al., 2019). There are however INDICations of episodic variations in AMOC during the Holocene (Bianchi and McCave, 1999; Oppo et al., 2003; Thornalley et al., 2013; Ayache et al., 2018), and past interglacial intervals (Galaasen et al., 2014, 2020; Hayes et al., 2014; Mokeddem et al., 2014; H. Huang et al., 2020). Over the last 3 kyr, there are INDICations that AMOC variability was potentially linked to decreasing production of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), one of the water masses contributing to AMOC (Alonso-Garcia et al., 2017; Moffa-Sánchez and Hall, 2017; Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019). Numerous proxy records collectively imply that AMOC is currently at its weakest point in the past 1.6 ka (Rahmstorf et al., 2015; Caesar et al., 2018, 2021; Thibodeau et al., 2018; Thornalley et al., 2018). Caesar et al. (2021) analyse a compilation of various available indirect AMOC proxies from marine sediments, in situ-based reconstructions and terrestrial proxies, which show a decline beginning in the late 19th century and over the 20th century superimposed by large decadal variability in the second half of the 20th century. Indirect reconstructions of AMOC components based on coastal sea level records in the western North Atlantic (Ezer, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Piecuch, 2020) show an AMOC decline since the late 1950s, with only a short period of recovery during the 1990s. However, other studies highlight that proxy records do not show such clear signals (Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019), and the use of SST- and coastal sea level-based proxies of AMOC places uncertainties on these results (Little et al., 2019; Jackson and Wood, 2020; Menary et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_2_77,2,70,"For instance, SSTs are additionally influenced by atmospheric and non-AMOC related ocean variability (Josey et al., 2018; Keil et al., 2020; Menary et al., 2020), while sea level responds to a variety of factors (e.g., atmospheric pressure and local winds) independent of the AMOC (Woodworth et al., 2014; Piecuch and Ponte, 2015; Piecuch et al., 2016). Finally, large decadal variability is present in many reconstructions and obscures estimation of the long-term trend over the 20th century (Ezer, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Yashayaev and Loder, 2016; Thornalley et al., 2018; Caesar et al., 2021). It is also noted that the proxy reported AMOC decline, beginning in the late 19th century, is not supported by model-based evidence (Sections 3.5.4.1 and 9.2.3.1). Since the 1980s, multiple lines of observational evidence for AMOC change exist. Ship-based hydrographic estimates of AMOC as far back as the 1980s show no overall decline in AMOC strength (Fu et al., 2020; Worthington et al., 2021). Direct INDICations from in-situ observations report a –2.5 ± 1.4 Sv change between 1993 and 2010 across the OVIDE section, superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability (Mercier et al., 2015). At 41°N and 26°N, a decline of –3.1 ± 3.2 Sv per decade and –2.5 ± 2.1 Sv per decade respectively has been reported over 2004–2016 (Baringer et al., 2018; Smeed et al., 2018). However, Moat et al. (2020) report an increase in AMOC strength at 26°N over 2009–2018. Recent time series of moored observations at 11ºS (Hummels et al., 2015), 34°S (Meinen et al., 2018; Kersalé et al., 2020), and between 57 and 60ºN (Lozier et al., 2019) are currently too short to permit robust conclusions about changes. The directly observed AMOC weakening since 2004, while significant, is over too short a period to assess whether it is part of a longer term trend or dominated by decadal‐scale internal variability (Smeed et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2019; Moat et al., 2020). Notably an increase and subsequent decline in the 1990s is present in estimates of AMOC and associated heat transport constructed from reanalyses or auxiliary data (Section 9.2.3.1; Frajka-Williams, 2015; Jackson et al., 2016; Trenberth and Fasullo, 2017; Jackson and Wood, 2020)."
AR6_WG1_2_78,2,70,"The intensity of the Kuroshio current system in the north-west Pacific varied in conjunction with the glaciation cycles over the last 1 Myr, with some limited glacial-interglacial variability in position (Jian et al., 2000; Gallagher et al., 2015). The Agulhas current has strengthened substantially during the warming associated with deglaciations of the past 1 Myr (Peeters et al., 2004; Bard and Rickaby, 2009; Martínez-Méndez et al., 2010; Marino et al., 2013; Ballalai et al., 2019). According to sediment core analyses, the Agulhas leakage varied by about 10 Sv during major climatic transitions over the past 640 kyr (Caley et al., 2014). Available data suggests that there was relatively little change in the net flow of the ACC during the LGM, with no consensus on the sign of changes (McCave et al., 2013; Lamy et al., 2015; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2016), except at one location at the northern edge of the Drake Passage where a 40% decrease of transport had been reported (Lamy et al., 2015). Longer time series from the northern entrance to Drake Passage suggest a consistent transport variability of 6–16% through glacial climate cycles, with higher current speeds during interglacial times and reduced current speeds during glacial intervals (Toyos et al., 2020). Inferred variability in the size and strength of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre was substantial, and included rapid changes on millennial time scales during both interglacial and glacial intervals over the last 150 kyr (Born and Levermann, 2010; Mokeddem et al., 2014; Irvalı et al., 2016; Mokeddem and McManus, 2016). North Atlantic – Arctic exchange has also varied in the past, with INDICations of an increasing inflow of Atlantic waters into the Arctic during the late Holocene (Ślubowska et al., 2005) with an acceleration to the recent inflow that is now the largest of the past 2 kyr (Spielhagen et al., 2011)."
AR6_WG1_2_79,2,71,"Southern Ocean circulation changes are assessed in SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019), and are confirmed and synthesized in Section 9.2.3.2 which shows that there is no INDICation of ACC transport change, and that it is unlikely that the mean meridional position of the ACC has moved southward in recent decades."
AR6_WG1_2_80,2,73,"Since AR5 evidence for changes in oxygen content based on new proxy reconstructions has increased (Hoogakker et al., 2015, 2018; Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020; Anderson et al., 2019). Paleo records point to past periods of reduced oceanic oxygen levels during the late Permian (about 250 Ma), the Jurassic and the Cretaceous (180–100 Ma), alongside associated global scale disturbances of the global carbon cycle. Emerging studies for the Cenozoic Era suggest more stable ocean oxygenation conditions throughout the interval on million-year time scales (X. Wang et al., 2016). Sedimentary proxy data INDICate, however, that the seemingly stable Cenozoic was punctuated by transient, widespread deoxygenation during the PETM (Dickson et al., 2012; Winguth et al., 2012; Remmelzwaal et al., 2019), with parts of the ocean reaching anoxic levels (Section 5.3.1.1; Yao et al., 2018). Since the LGM, there was an overall emergence and expansion of low-oxygen waters into the ocean intermediate depths as a result of rapid warming and a reorganization of the global overturning circulation (Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015). The maximum expansion of oxygen-depleted waters during the LDT occurred coincidently with rapid warming in the NH at 14.7–12.9 ka (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Moffitt et al., 2015; Hoogakker et al., 2018). Deep (>1500 m) ocean oxygen levels increased by 100–150 µmol kg –1 since the LGM, reaching modern oxygen levels at about 10 ka (Section 5.3.1.2; Hoogakker et al., 2015; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2019)."

AR6_WG1_2_82,2,74,"−6 observatory in Hawaii since the early 1960s is only about half as large as at Barrow (Graven et al., 2013), and only one other low- latitude observatory has a significant increase from 1980–2012 (Piao et al., 2018). There is a weak signal of an increase in amplitude at the Sinhagad observatory in western India in recent years (Chakraborty et al., 2020). Generally speaking, larger increases in the Arctic and boreal regions are INDICative of changes in vegetation and carbon cycle dynamics in northern ecosystems (Forkel et al., 2016), though increased carbon uptake can also result from other factors such as warmer- and wetter-than-normal conditions. Recent satellite-based, global-scale estimates of seasonal variations in atmospheric CO for the period 2003–2018 show that the seasonal variations in the SH are out of phase with those in the NH (Reuter et al., 2020), which is consistent with the phenological shifts in primary productivity between hemispheres. The net effect of the phase shift between the two hemispheres is to dampen the amplitude of the global average seasonal cycle. These integrated results also show that the amplitude of the oscillations has been increasing in the SH, from about 2009, but comparison with data from Baring head suggests that periods of high seasonal oscillation had occurred at that location in the SH prior to 1995."
AR6_WG1_2_83,2,74,"SROCC pointed out that long-term global observations of many key ocean variables, including phytoplankton, have not reached the density and accuracy necessary for detecting change. But SROCC noted the good comparability between short time-scale single-sensor ocean-colour products and a longer time-scale, climate-quality time series of multi-sensor, inter-sensor-bias-corrected, and error- characterized, global data on chlorophyll-a concentration in the surface layers of the ocean. With respect to oligotrophic gyres, AR5 WGII concluded that the oligotrophic subtropical gyres of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are expanding and that they INDICate declining phytoplankton stocks in these waters (limited evidence, low agreement). With respect to distributions of marine organisms, AR5 WGII reported range shifts of benthic, pelagic, and demersal species and communities (high confidence), though the shifts were not uniform."
AR6_WG1_2_84,2,74,"Phytoplankton are responsible for marine primary production through photosynthesis; they are a major player in the ocean carbon cycle. They have a high metabolic rate and respond fast to changes in environmental conditions (light, temperature, nutrients, mixing), and as such, serve as a key INDICATOR for change in marine ecosystems."
AR6_WG1_2_85,2,75,"Phytoplankton dynamics in the ocean (a) Climatology: Chlorophyll concentration (b) Linear trends: Chlorophyll concentration data in many regions is strongly tied to INDICES of climate variability (Section 2.4 and Annex IV) and changes in total concentration are typically associated with changes in phytoplankton community structure (e.g., Brewin et al., 2012; Racault et al., 2017b). Variability in community structure related to El Niño has, in turn, been linked to variability in fisheries, for example in the catch of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) in the Humboldt current ecosystem (Jackson et al., 2011). Since AR5 WGII, analysis of a longer time series of ocean-colour data (1998–2012) has shown (Aiken et al., 2017) that the expansion of the low nutrient part of the North Atlantic oligotrophic gyre was significant, at 0.27 × 10 6 km 2 per decade, but that the rate was much lower than that reported earlier by Polovina et al. (2008). Furthermore, Aiken et al. (2017) reported no significant trend in the oligotrophic area of the South Atlantic Gyre. With the time series extended to 2016, von Schuckmann et al. (2018) reported that since 2007, there was a general decreasing trend in the areas of the North and South Pacific oligotrophic Gyres, while the North and South Atlantic oligotrophic Gyres remained stable, with little change in area, consistent with Aiken et al. (2017). The changing sign of trends in the areal extent of the oligotrophic gyres with increase in the length of the time series raises the possibility that these changes arise from interannual to multi-decadal variability. The time series of ocean-colour data is too short to discern any trend that might be superimposed on such variability."
AR6_WG1_2_86,2,75,"Similarly, there is limited consistent and long-term information on large-scale distributions of marine organisms at higher trophic levels. But there are increased INDICations since AR5 and SROCC that the distributions of various higher trophic-level organisms are shifting both polewards and to deeper levels (Edwards et al., 2016; Haug et al., 2017; Atkinson et al., 2019; Lenoir et al., 2020; Pinsky et al., 2020), mostly consistent with changes in temperature. However observations also show a smaller set of counter-intuitive migrations towards warmer and shallower waters, which could be related to changes in phenology and in larval transport by currents (Fuchs et al., 2020). There are also strengthening INDICations of greater representation by species with warm-water affinity in marine communities, consistent with expectations under observed warming (Burrows et al., 2019). There are INDICations that pre-1850 CE plankton communities are different from their modern counterparts globally (Jonkers et al., 2019). INDICATORs of geographical distributions of species (mostly from coastal waters) suggest that the rates at which some species are leaving or arriving at an ecosystem are variable, leading to changes in community composition (Blowes et al., 2019), with likely greater representation of warm-water species in some locations (Burrows et al., 2019). In summary, there is high confidence that the latitudinal and depth limits of the distribution of various organisms in the marine biome are changing. There is medium confidence that there are differences in the responses of individual species relative to each other, such that the species compositions of ecosystems are changing. There is medium confidence that chlorophyll concentration in the surface shows weak negative and positive trends in parts of low and mid latitudes, and weak positive trends in some high-latitude areas. There is medium confidence that the large-scale distribution of the oligotrophic gyre provinces is subject to significant inter-annual variations, but"
AR6_WG1_2_87,2,76,"Phenology is the study of the timing of important events in the annual life cycle of organisms (plants or animals; see also Annex VII: Glossary). The AR5 WGII noted that the timing of various seasonal biological events in the ocean had advanced by more than four days per decade over the previous 50-year period and concluded that there was high confidence in observed changes in the phenological metrics of marine organisms. The AR5 WGII further reported that, of those observations that showed a response, 81% of changes in phenology, distribution and abundance were consistent with anticipated responses to climate warming according to theoretical expectations, corroborated by updates in SROCC. The consequent current and future impacts on interactions between species, including competition and predator-prey dynamics, were noted with high confidence. There are additional INDICations that phenological metrics related to different species are changing, but not always in a similar manner. For example, many seabirds are breeding earlier, while others are breeding later (Sydeman et al., 2015). Planktonic organisms in the North Atlantic are also responding differently to each other"
AR6_WG1_2_88,2,76,"when subjected to the same environmental changes (Edwards and Richardson, 2004). Furthermore, different factors could be responsible for triggering phenological responses in different stages in the life cycle of a single organism (Koeller et al., 2009). The shift in the distribution of many benthic invertebrates on the North-west Atlantic shelf, including some commercially important shellfish, could be explained by phenology and larval transport, and the shift and contraction of species range have been associated with higher mortality (Fuchs et al., 2020). Changes in phytoplankton phenological INDICATORs globally (Racault et al., 2012; Sapiano et al., 2012) have been linked to INDICATORs of climate variability, such as the multivariate ENSO INDEX (Racault et al., 2017a), with responses varying across ecological provinces of the ocean (Longhurst, 2007)."
AR6_WG1_2_89,2,76,"Phenological links between multiple components of an ecosystem have to be maintained intact, to retain system integrity. Since all higher pelagic organisms depend on phytoplankton for their food, either directly or indirectly, a match favours survival, and a mismatch is antagonistic to survival. Match represents synchronicity in the phenological events of both prey and predator. There are INDICations from ocean-colour data used in conjunction with fisheries data that the survival rate of various larger marine organisms depends on phenological metrics related to the seasonality of phytoplankton growth. Such links have been demonstrated, for example, for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in the North-west Atlantic (Platt et al., 2003); northern shrimp in the North Atlantic (Koeller et al., 2009; Ouellet et al., 2011); sardine (Sardinella aurita) off the Ivory coast (Kassi et al., 2018); cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae in the North-West Atlantic (Trzcinski et al., 2013); and oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps) off the south-west coast of India. Borstad et al. (2011) showed that fledgling production rate of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) on a remote island in coastal north-eastern Pacific was related to seasonal values of chlorophyll-a biomass in the vicinity of the island."

Satellite-based records suggest that most NH regions have experienced both an earlier start and a later end to the growing season, a finding supported by ground-based data (Piao et al., 2020). A number of studies also capture increases in growing season length over the Canadian Arctic (W.

Climate has varied across a broad range of timescales (Figure 2.34). During the Cenozoic Era temperatures generally decreased over tens of millions of years, leading to the development of ice sheets.

The direct observations point unequivocally to rapid change across many INDICATORs of the climate system since the mid-19th century. These are all consistent in INDICating a world that has warmed rapidly."
AR6_WG1_2_98,2,81,Assessing the long-term context of recent changes is key to understanding their potential importance and implications. The climate system consists of many observable aspects that vary over a very broad range of timescales. Some biogeochemical INDICATORs of change such as atmospheric CO concentrations and ocean pH have shifted rapidly and CO concentrations are currently at levels unseen in at least 800 kyr (the period of continuous polar ice-core records) and very likely for millions of years.

AR6_WG1_2_104,2,84,"The AR5 reported that the shift towards a positive NAO, a mode of variability in the North Atlantic that is closely related to the hemispheric-scale NAM, from the 1950s to the 1990s was largely reversed by more recent changes (high confidence). Moreover, periods of persistent negative or positive NAO states observed during the latter part of the 20th century were not unusual, based on NAO reconstructions spanning the last half millennium (high confidence). New multi-millennial-timescale NAO reconstructions are derived from marine and lake sediments, speleothems, tree rings and ice cores (Ortega et al., 2015; Faust et al., 2016; Sjolte et al., 2018). NAO variability over the past 8 kyr suggests the presence of a significant 1.5 kyr periodicity (Darby et al., 2012). Positive NAO conditions dominated during the MH, while the prevailing NAO sign during the early and late Holocene was negative according to most reconstructions (Olsen et al., 2012; Ait Brahim et al., 2019; Røthe et al., 2019; Hernández et al., 2020). For the CE, reconstructions developed since AR5 INDICate no dominant NAO phase during 1000–1300 CE (Jones et al., 2014; Baker et al., 2015; Ortega et al., 2015; Lasher and Axford, 2019; Hernández et al., 2020), with either negative (Baker et al., 2015; Faust et al., 2016; Mellado-Cano et al., 2019) or a more variable phase of the NAO (Jones et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2015; Sjolte et al., 2018; Cook et al., 2019) between 1400 and 1850 CE. Several instrument-based NAO reconstructions extending back to the 17th and 18th centuries highlight the presence of multi- decadal variations in the NAO phases (Cornes et al., 2013; Cropper et al., 2015), although these studies have limitations considering the seasonality of the centres of action and the locations of the stations used. Recent reconstructions of the large scale sea level pressure field yield more robust NAO analysis, showing a persistently negative NAO phase from the 1820s to the 1870s, with positive values dominating during the beginning of the 20th century followed by a declining trend over 1920–1970, with a recovery thereafter to a period of consistently high values between 1970 and the early 1990s (Delaygue et al., 2019; Mellado-Cano et al., 2019). Based on the evaluation of several NAO reconstructions for recent centuries, Hernández et al. (2020) highlighted that the strong positive NAO phases of the 1990s and early 21st century were not unusual."
AR6_WG1_2_105,2,84,"The predominantly positive phase during the 1990s was followed by partial reversal and a tendency towards stronger variability in boreal winter NAM and NAO since the late 1990s (Pinto and Raible, 2012; Hanna et al., 2018). This is particularly evident in December NAO (Hanna et al., 2015) and NAM (Overland and Wang, 2015) INDICES, and is not unusual on multi-decadal time scales (Woollings et al., 2018a). Since the 1990s, a statistically significant summer NAO decline was reported, which is, to a lesser extent, also evident in the winter NAO, linked to an enhanced blocking activity over Greenland (Hanna et al., 2015, 2016; Wachowicz et al., 2021). However, this was moderated by persistent positive NAO values since 2015 (Annex IV.2.1). Based on observations and reanalysis datasets, multi-decadal variations were found for the NAM patterns: the Atlantic centre remained unchanged throughout 1920–2010, whereas the Pacific centre was stronger during 1920–1959 and 1986–2010 and weaker during 1960–1985 (Gong et al., 2018). Multidecadal changes were also observed in the position of the centres of action of the NAO (Moore et al., 2013; Zuo et al., 2016)."
AR6_WG1_2_106,2,84,"In summary, positive trends for the NAM/NAO winter INDICES were observed between the 1960s and the early 1990s, but these INDICES have become less positive or even negative thereafter (high confidence). The NAO variability in the instrumental record was very likely not unusual in the millennial and multi-centennial context."
AR6_WG1_2_107,2,85,"some disagreements exist between proxy records before 1800 CE (Hessl et al., 2017). Abram et al. (2014) concluded that the mean SAM INDEX during recent decades is at its highest levels for at least the last 1 kyr. Similarly, the summer SAM reconstruction by Dätwyler et al. (2018) INDICates a strengthening over the last 60 years that is outside the very likely range of the last millennium natural variability. The largest 30- and 50-year trends in the annual SAM INDEX occurred at the end of the 20th century (after 1969 and 1950 respectively), INDICating that the recent increase in the SAM is unprecedented in the context of at least the past three centuries (Yang and Xiao, 2018)."
AR6_WG1_2_108,2,85,"Before the mid-1950s, SAM INDICES derived from station-based datasets, and centennial reanalyses show pronounced interannual and decadal variability but no significant trends, with low correlation between SAM INDICES due to the diversity across different datasets and sensitivity to the definition used for the INDEX calculation (Barrucand et al., 2018; Schneider and Fogt, 2018; J. Lee et al., 2019). Various SAM INDICES exhibit significant positive trends since the 1950s, particularly during austral summer and autumn (Barrucand et al., 2018; Schneider and Fogt, 2018; J. Lee et al., 2019), unprecedented for austral summer over the last 150 years (J.M. Jones et al., 2016; Fogt and Marshall, 2020). This INDICates a strengthening of the surface westerly winds around Antarctica, related to both the position and intensity of the subpolar jet in the SH (Section 2.3.1.4.3; Ivy et al., 2017; IPCC, 2019). The SAM trends have slightly weakened after about 2000 (Fogt and Marshall, 2020)."
AR6_WG1_2_109,2,85,"In summary, historical station-based reconstructions of the SAM show that there has been a robust positive trend in the SAM INDEX, particularly since 1950 and for the austral summer (high confidence). The recent positive trend in the SAM is likely unprecedented in at least the past millennium, although medium confidence arises due to the differences between proxy records before 1800 CE."
AR6_WG1_2_110,2,85,"The AR5 reported with medium confidence that ENSO-like variability existed, at least sporadically, during the warm background state of the Pliocene. It was also found (high confidence) that ENSO has remained highly variable during the last 7 kyr with no discernible orbital modulation. The AR5 concluded that large variability on interannual to decadal timescales, and differences between datasets, precluded robust conclusions on any changes in ENSO during the instrumental period. The SROCC reported epochs of strong ENSO variability throughout the Holocene, with no INDICations of a systematic trend in ENSO amplitude, but with some INDICation that the ENSO amplitude over 1979–2009 was greater than at any point in the period from 1590–1880 CE. It was also reported that the frequency and intensity of El Niño events in the period from 1951–2000 was high relative to 1901–1950."
AR6_WG1_2_111,2,85,"Manucharyan and Fedorov (2014) found that ENSO-like variability has been present, at least sporadically, during epochs of millions of years (including the MPWP; Cross-Chapter Box 2.4), with proxy records INDICating that this was the case even when cross-Pacific SST gradients were much weaker than present. There is substantial disagreement between proxy records for ENSO activity during the early Holocene (Zhang et al., 2014; White et al., 2018), and for ENSO activity and mean state at the LGM (Leduc et al., 2009; Koutavas and Joanides, 2012; Sadekov et al., 2013; Ford et al., 2015, 2018; Zhu et al., 2017; Tierney et al., 2020). A number of studies (Cobb et al., 2013; H. McGregor et al., 2013; Carré et al., 2014; Emile-Geay et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2017; White et al., 2018; Grothe et al., 2019) have found that ENSO was substantially weaker than at present at various times in the mid- Holocene within the period from 6 to 3 ka, with stronger decreases in variability revealed by remote proxies than by those close to the core region of ENSO activity. However, Karamperidou et al. (2015) find that weakening in ENSO-related variability in eastern Pacific proxies does not necessarily correspond to weakening in central Pacific proxies. Barrett et al. (2018) concluded that multi-proxy reconstructions are more efficient at identifying eastern Pacific than central Pacific events. This suggests that a weakening of proxy-based signals may INDICate an along-equatorial shift in ENSO activity rather than a weakening of ENSO during some periods. Following the period of weak ENSO variability in the mid-Holocene, a number of studies find an increase in ENSO activity which, depending upon the study, commences between 4.4 and 3 ka (Koutavas and Joanides, 2012; Cobb et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014; S. Chen et al., 2016; Emile-Geay et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021)."
AR6_WG1_2_112,2,86,"Variance ERSSTv5, addressed known SST biases in ERSSTv3 in the equatorial Pacific which affected the derived mean state and amplitude of INDICES based on that dataset (Huang et al., 2015). During the instrumental period, there is no robust INDICation of any significant century-scale trend in the east-west SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, with periods when gradients have been stronger and weaker than the long-term average on decadal timescales, associated with a predominance of La Niña or El Niño events respectively. The frequency of El Niño and La Niña events is also subject to considerable decadal variability (e.g., Hu et al., 2013) but with no INDICation of a long-term signal in the frequency of events. The ENSO amplitude since 1950 has increased relative to the 1910–1950 period, as confirmed by independent proxy records (e.g., Gergis and Fowler, 2009), the Southern Oscillation INDEX (SOI) (Braganza et al., 2009) and SSTs (e.g., Ohba, 2013; Yu and Kim, 2013), although there is a spread between different proxy and instrumental sources as to the magnitude of that increase (Figure 2.36). The El Niño events of 1982–1983, 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 had the strongest anomalies in the Niño 3.4 SST INDEX since 1950. Their predominance was less evident from INDICES based on de-trended data such as the Oceanic Niño INDEX (ONI) (which still ranked them as the three strongest events since 1950, but only by a small margin), and in the SOI. B. Huang et al. (2019a) also note that analyses based upon buoy and Argo data, which are only available since the 1990s, are more capable of resolving strong events than analyses which do not include such data."
AR6_WG1_2_113,2,86,"Prior to the 1950s, SST observations in the tropical Pacific were much sparser and hence uncertainties in Niño INDICES are much larger (B. Huang et al., 2020). SOI data and some newer SST-based studies show high ENSO amplitude, comparable to the post-1950 period, in the period from the mid-late 19th century to about 1910, but proxy INDICATORs generally INDICate that the late 19th and early 20th century were less active than the late 20th century (Figure 2.36). Yu and Kim’s (2013) implementation of the ONI found a number of events with the ONI above 1.5°C between 1888 and 1905, then no such events until 1972, whilst the SOI INDICates comparable or stronger events to the three strongest post-1950 events in 1896 and 1905. Giese and Ray (2011) also found a number of such events between 1890 and 1920 in the SODA ocean reanalysis, corroborated further by B. Huang et al. (2020) and Vaccaro et al. (2021), who found that the strength of the 1877–1878 event was comparable with that of the 1982–1983, 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 events. There have also been a number of strong La Niña events (e.g., 1973–1974, 1975–1976 and 2010–2011), with few clear analogues in the 1920–1970 period; the proxy-based analysis of McGregor et al. (2010) INDICates that the mid-1970s La Niña period was also extreme in a multi-centennial context. There is no INDICation that the frequency of high-amplitude events since the 1970s reflects a long-term trend which can be separated from multi- decadal variability, given apparent presence of several high-amplitude events in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the relatively large uncertainty in pre-1950 SST data in the tropical Pacific region."
AR6_WG1_2_114,2,87,"Timmermann et al., 2018). A number of studies, using a range of INDICATORs, have found an increase in recent decades of the fraction of CP El Niño events, particularly after 2000 (Yu and Kim, 2013; Lübbecke and McPhaden, 2014; Pascolini-Campbell et al., 2015; Jiang and Zhu, 2018). Johnson (2013) found that the frequency of CP El Niño events had increased (although not significantly) over the 1950–2011 period, being accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of La Niña events with a warm (as opposed to cool) western Pacific warm pool. A coral-based reconstruction starting in 1600 CE (Freund et al., 2019) found that the ratio of CP to EP events in the last 30 years was substantially higher than at any other time over the last 400 years. Variations in the proportion of CP and EP events have also been found in earlier periods, with Carré et al. (2014) finding a period of high CP activity around 7 ka."
AR6_WG1_2_115,2,87,"There is no robust INDICation of any changes in ENSO teleconnections over multi-centennial timescales (Hernández et al., 2020) despite multi- decadal variability. Shi and Wang (2018) found that teleconnections with the broader Asian summer monsoon, including the Indian and the East Asian monsoon, were generally stable since the 17th century during the developing phase of the monsoon, and showed substantial decadal variability, but no clear trend, during the decaying phase. They also found that the weakening of teleconnections between the Indian summer monsoon and ENSO in recent decades had numerous precedents over the last few centuries. Räsänen et al. (2016) also found substantial decadal variability, but little trend, in the strength of the relationship between ENSO and monsoon precipitation in South East Asia between 1650 and 2000. Dätwyler et al. (2019) identified a number of multi-decadal periods with apparently changed teleconnections at times over the last 400 years."
AR6_WG1_2_116,2,87,"In summary, there is medium confidence that both ENSO amplitude and the frequency of high-magnitude events since 1950 are higher than over the period from 1850 and possibly as far back as 1400, but low confidence that they are outside the range of variability over periods prior to 1400, or higher than the average of the Holocene as a whole. Overall, there is no INDICation of a recent sustained shift in ENSO or associated features such as the Walker Circulation, or in"
AR6_WG1_2_117,2,87,"The AR5 did not provide an assessment of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) records based on paleo reconstructions. For the instrumental era, AR5 reported that there were no trends in the IOD behaviour. However, the strength of the Indian Ocean Basin-wide (IOB) mode, quantified by the basin-scale averaged SST INDEX, increased in all assessed periods except 1979–2012, but the AR5 neither quantified trends nor provided a confidence statement."
AR6_WG1_2_118,2,88,"The role of decadal to multi-decadal variability has recently emerged as an important aspect of the IOD with many INDICations of the effects of Pacific Ocean processes on IOD variability through atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms (Dong et al., 2016; Krishnamurthy and Krishnamurthy, 2016; Zhou et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018). Positive events in the 1960s and 1990s were linked to a relatively shallow eastern Indian Ocean thermocline, and a primarily negative IOD state in the 1970s and 1980s was related to a deeper thermocline (Ummenhofer et al., 2016). Positive IOD events may have increased in frequency during the second half of the 20th century (Abram et al., 2020a, b). Earlier observations of apparent changes in the frequency and/or magnitude of the IOD events are considered unreliable, particularly prior to the 1960s (Hernández et al., 2020).

AR6_WG1_2_119,2,89,"Paleo-reconstructions of these two modes remain rather limited. Nonetheless, the interhemispheric cross-equatorial SST gradients linked to changes in ITCZ locations characteristic of the AMM has been found during the LGM, Heinrich Stadial 1, and the MH, with the largest shift occurring during HS1 (McGee et al., 2014). Similarly, the dipole-like SST pattern in the South Atlantic subtropics, which is related to the AZM (Venegas et al., 1996; Morioka et al., 2011; Nnamchi et al., 2016, 2017; Lübbecke et al., 2018; Rouault et al., 2018; Foltz et al., 2019), has been reconstructed using SST proxies from marine sediment cores during the past 12 kyr (Wainer et al., 2014). The reconstructed INDEX captures two significant cold events that occurred during the 12.9–11.6 ka and 8.6–8.0 ka periods in the South Atlantic (Wainer et al., 2014)."
AR6_WG1_2_120,2,89,"Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) refers to the ocean-atmosphere climate variability over the Pacific Ocean at decadal-to-interdecadal time scales and is usually described by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) INDICES. The AR5 and SROCC reported a large shift of the PDO in the late 1970s,"
AR6_WG1_2_121,2,89,"The existence of the PDV in the centuries prior to the instrumental period is evidenced by a variety of proxy records based on tree rings (Biondi et al., 2001; D’Arrigo and Ummenhofer, 2015), corals (Felis et al., 2010; Deng et al., 2013; Linsley et al., 2015) and sediments (Lapointe et al., 2017; O’Mara et al., 2019). There is little coherence between the various paleo-proxy INDICES prior to the instrumental record, and neither these nor the instrumental records provide INDICations of a clearly defined spectral peak (Chen and Wallace, 2015; M. Newman et al., 2016; Henley, 2017; L. Zhang et al., 2018; Buckley et al., 2019). For instance, spectral analysis from millennia length PDV reconstructions shows spectral peaks at multi-decadal, centennial and bi-centennial time scales (Beaufort and Grelaud, 2017), while only multi-decadal oscillations can be detected in the shorter (less than 400 years into the past) paleoclimate reconstructions. A variety of proxies suggest a shift in the PDV from the early-mid Holocene, which was characterized by a persistently negative phase of the PDO (i.e., weak Aleutian Low), to the late Holocene, and more variable and more positive PDO (i.e., strong Aleutian Low) conditions. This shift at around 4.5 ka is also evident in the PDO periodicities, changing from bidecadal and pentadecadal variability in the early Holocene to only pentadecadal periodicities in the late Holocene (Hernández et al., 2020). Several proxy records INDICate that the strengthening in the Aleutian Low inferred since the late 17th century is unprecedented over the last millennium (Z. Liu et al., 2017; Osterberg et al., 2017; Winski et al., 2017), in line with an increase in PDV low-frequency variability (Williams et al., 2017; Hernández et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_2_122,2,89,"The PDO and IPO INDICES are significantly correlated during the instrumental period, showing regime shifts in the 1920s, 1940s, 1970s and around 1999. Positive PDV phases were observed from the 1920s to the mid-1940s and from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, while negative phases occurred from mid-1940s until the late 1970s, and since 1999 (Figure 2.38; Han et al., 2014; Chen and Wallace, 2015; M. Newman et al., 2016). The associated spatial patterns are quite similar, but the PDO pattern exhibits stronger SST anomalies in the extra-tropical North Pacific than the IPO (Chen and Wallace, 2015). The strength and structure of the SST patterns also differ among the periods (M. Newman et al., 2016)."
AR6_WG1_2_123,2,89,"Instrumental observations are sparse prior to 1950, and thus the fidelity of any PDV INDEX derived for the second part of the 19th century and early decades of the 20th century is relatively low (Figure 2.38; Deng et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2014). This results in low agreement in the classification of the PDO/IPO phase among several INDICES, even during recent years with the availability of high- quality data. Nevertheless, the teleconnection patterns are robust regardless of the INDEX used to characterize the PDO (McAfee, 2017). Analysis of time series of PDO and IPO highlights the (multi-) decadal nature of this mode of variability with no significant trends, but highlights a recent switch from a positive to a negative phase since 1999/2000 across all INDICATORs (England et al., 2014; Henley, 2017)."
AR6_WG1_2_124,2,90,The AR5 reported no robust changes in Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) reconstructions based on paleo records due to low consistency between different AMV reconstructions prior to 1900. AR5 concluded that there have been no significant trends in the AMV INDEX during the instrumental period and there was difficulty in interpreting the AMV signal because of the long-term underlying SST warming trend.
AR6_WG1_2_125,2,90,"The AR5 conclusions about large uncertainties in AMV paleo reconstructions (Hernández et al., 2020) have been reinforced by recent studies of tree rings (J. Wang et al., 2017b), Greenland ice (Chylek et al., 2012), and corals (Kilbourne et al., 2014; Svendsen et al., 2014b; J. Wang et al., 2017b). The AMV exhibited a generally positive state over the first millennium of the CE (Mann et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2018). Paleo reconstructions over the last millennium consistently show a negative AMV phase during 1400–1850 CE and a positive phase during 900–1200 CE (Mann et al., 2009; J. Wang et al., 2017b; Singh et al., 2018), consistent with warmer surface temperatures from tropical Atlantic records (Kilbourne et al., 2014). Instrumental observations show that AMV is characterized by basin-wide warm and cool periods with an average variation in SST of about 0.4°C, but with larger variations in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Despite small differences in INDICES used to define the AMV (Annex IV), they all show warm periods occurring approximately between 1880–1900, 1940–1960, and from the mid-1990s to present, with cool periods in between (Figure 2.38) but no overall sustained change during the instrumental period (Booth et al., 2012; Gulev et al., 2013; Bellomo et al., 2018). The oceanic changes are seen in salinity and temperature variations over the upper 3000 m of the North Atlantic (Polyakov et al., 2005; Keenlyside et al., 2015), and in sea level variations in the western North Atlantic along the Gulf Stream passage (McCarthy et al., 2015). The pattern and strength of the AMV differs among the periods (e.g., Svendsen et al., 2014b; Reynolds et al., 2018) and there are INDICations that there may have been a shift since 2005 toward a negative phase of the AMV (Robson et al., 2016). In summary, no sustained change in AMV INDICES has been observed over the instrumental period (high confidence). However, instrumental records may not be long enough to distinguish any oscillatory behaviour from trends in the AMV. There is low confidence in the paleo AMV reconstructions due to a paucity of high-resolution records."
AR6_WG1_2_126,2,90,"• Development of new techniques and exploitation of existing and new proxy sources may help address challenges around the low temporal resolution of most paleoclimate proxy records, particularly prior to the Common Era, and ambiguities around converting paleoclimate proxy data into estimates of climate- relevant variables. Conversions rely upon important proxy-specific assumptions and biases can be large due to limited accounting of seasonality, non-climatic effects, or the influence of multiple climate variables. These challenges currently limit the ability to ascertain the historical unusualness of recent directly observed climate changes for many INDICATORs. {2.2, 2.3} • Improved sharing of historical instrumental and proxy records (including metadata) along with significant efforts at data rescue of presently undigitized records would serve to significantly strengthen many aspects of the present assessment.

AR6_WG1_3_1,3,6,"This chapter assesses the evidence for human influence on observed large-scale INDICATORs of climate change that are described in Cross-Chapter Box 2.2 and assessed in Chapter 2. It takes advantage of the longer period of record now available in many observational datasets. The assessment of the human-induced contribution to observed climate change requires an estimate of the expected response to human influence, as well as an estimate of the expected climate evolution due to natural forcings and an estimate of variability internal to the climate system (internal climate variability). For this we need high quality models, primarily climate and Earth system models. Since AR5, a new set of coordinated model results from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6; Eyring et al., 2016a) has become available. Together with updated observations of large-scale INDICATORs of climate change (Chapter 2), CMIP simulations are a key resource for assessing human influence on the climate system. Pre-industrial control and historical simulations are of most relevance for model evaluation and assessment of internal variability, and these simulations are evaluated to assess fitness-for-purpose for attribution, which is the focus of this chapter (see also Section 1.5.4). This chapter provides the primary evaluation of large-scale INDICATORs of climate change in this Report, and is complemented by other fitness-for- purpose evaluations in subsequent chapters. CMIP6 also includes an extensive set of idealized and single forcing experiments for attribution Chapter 3: Quick guide"
AR6_WG1_3_2,3,7,"This chapter starts with a brief description of methods for detection and attribution of observed changes in Section 3.2, which builds on the more general introduction to attribution approaches in the Cross- Working Group Box on Attribution in Chapter 1. In this chapter we assess the detection of anthropogenic influence on climate on large spatial scales and long temporal scales, a concept related to, but distinct from, that of the emergence of anthropogenically-induced climate change from the range of internal variability on local scales and shorter time scales (Section 1.4.2.2). The following sections address the climate system component by component, in each case assessing human influence and evaluating climate models’ simulations of the relevant aspects of climate and climate change. This chapter assesses the evaluation and attribution of global, hemispheric, continental and ocean basin-scale INDICATORs of climate change in the atmosphere and at the Earth’s surface (Section 3.3), cryosphere (Section 3.4), ocean (Section 3.5), and biosphere (Section 3.6), and the evaluation and attribution of modes of variability (Section 3.7), the period of slower warming in the early 21st century (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1) and large-scale changes in extremes (Cross- Chapter Box 3.2). Model evaluation and attribution on sub-continental scales are not covered here, since these are assessed in the Atlas and in Chapter 10, and extreme event attribution is not covered since it is assessed in Chapter 11. Section 3.8 assesses multivariate attribution and integrative measures of model performance based on multiple variables, as well as process representation in different classes of models. The chapter structure is summarized in Figure 3.1."
AR6_WG1_3_3,3,7,"New methods for model evaluation that are used in this chapter are described in Section 1.5.4. These include new techniques for process-based evaluation of climate and Earth system models against observations that have rapidly advanced since the publication of AR5 (Eyring et al., 2019) as well as newly developed CMIP evaluation tools that allow a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation of the models with observations (Eyring et al., 2016a, b). In this chapter, we use the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool, Eyring et al., 2020; Lauer et al., 2020; Righi et al., 2020) and the NCAR Climate Variability Diagnostic Package (CVDP, Phillips et al., 2014) that is included in the ESMValTool to produce most of the figures. This ensures traceability of the results and provides an additional level of quality control. The ESMValTool code to produce the figures in this chapter was released as open source software at the time of the publication of this Report (see details in the Chapter Data Table, Table SM.3.1). Figures in this chapter are produced either using one ensemble member from each model, or using all available ensemble members and weighting each simulation by 1/(NM ), where N is the number of models and M is the ensemble size of the ith model, prior to calculating means and percentiles. Both approaches ensure that each model used is given equal weight in the figures, and details on which approach is used are provided in the figure captions. An introduction to recent developments in detection and attribution methods in the context of this Report is provided in the Cross- Working Group Box on Attribution in Chapter 1. Here we discuss new methods and improvements applicable to the attribution of changes in large-scale INDICATORs of climate change which are used in this chapter."
AR6_WG1_3_4,3,8,"Climate change signals can vary with time and discriminant analysis has been used to obtain more accurate estimates of time-varying signals, and has been applied to different variables such as seasonal temperatures (Jia and DelSole, 2012) and the South Asian monsoon (Srivastava and DelSole, 2014). The same approach was applied to separate aerosol forcing responses from other forcings (X. Yan et al., 2016) and results using climate model output INDICated that detectability of the aerosol response is maximized by using a combination of temperature and precipitation data. Paeth et al. (2017) introduced a detection and attribution method applicable for multiple variables based on a discriminant analysis and a Bayesian classification method. Finally, a systematic approach has been proposed to translating quantitative analysis into a description of confidence in the detection and attribution of a climate response to anthropogenic drivers (Stone and Hansen, 2016)."
AR6_WG1_3_5,3,8,"Surface temperature change is the aspect of climate in which the climate research community has had most confidence over past IPCC assessment reports. This confidence comes from the availability of longer observational records compared to other INDICATORs, a large response to anthropogenic forcing compared to variability in the global mean, and a strong theoretical understanding of the key thermodynamics driving its changes (Collins et al., 2010; Shepherd, 2014). The AR5 assessed that it was extremely likely that human activities had caused more than"
AR6_WG1_3_6,3,9,"LGM simulation by the Community Earth System Model Version 2.1 (CESM2.1) is an exception related to the high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of that model (Section 7.5.6; Kageyama et al., 2021a; Zhu et al., 2021). Figure 3.2a illustrates the wide range of simulated global LGM temperature responses in both ensembles. CMIP6 models tend to underestimate the cooling over land, but agree better with oceanic reconstructions. For the mid-Holocene, the regional biases found in CMIP5 simulations are similar to those in pre-industrial and historical simulations (Harrison et al., 2015; Ackerley et al., 2017), suggesting common causes. CMIP5 models underestimate Arctic warming in the mid-Holocene (Yoshimori and Suzuki, 2019). CMIP6 models simulate a mid-latitude, subtropical, and tropical cooling compared to the pre-industrial period, whereas temperature proxies INDICate a warming (see Section 2.3.1.1.2; Brierley et al., 2020; Kaufman et al., 2020), although accounting for seasonal effects in the proxies may reduce the discrepancy (Bova et al., 2021). Over the past millennium, reconstructed and simulated temperature anomalies, internal variability, and forced response agree well over Northern Hemisphere continents, but those statistics disagree strongly in the Southern Hemisphere, where models seem to overestimate the response (PAGES 2k-PMIP3 group, 2015). That disagreement is partly explained by the lower quality of the reconstructions in the Southern Hemisphere, but model and/or forcing errors may also contribute (Neukom et al., 2018). Figure 3.2b shows that land/sea warming contrast behaves coherently in model simulations across multiple periods, with a slight non-linearity in land warming due to a smaller contribution of snow cover to temperature response in warmer climates. A multivariate assessment of paleoclimate model simulations is carried out in Section 3.8.2."
AR6_WG1_3_7,3,11,"Stevens, 2019). In addition, the biases of the limited number of models participating in HighResMIP are not entirely representative of overall CMIP6 biases, especially in the Southern Ocean, as INDICated by comparing panels b and f of Figure 3.3."
AR6_WG1_3_8,3,11,"The AR5 assessed with very high confidence that models reproduce the general history of the increase in global-scale annual mean surface temperature since the year 1850, although AR5 also reported that an observed reduction in the rate of warming over the period 1998–2012 was not reproduced by the models (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1; Flato et al., 2013). Figure 3.2c and Figure 3.4 show time series of anomalies in annually and globally averaged surface temperature simulated by CMIP5 and CMIP6 models for the past millennium and the period 1850 to 2020, respectively, with the baseline set to 1850–1900 (see Section 1.4.1). As also INDICated by Figure 3.4, the spread in simulated absolute temperatures is large (Palmer and Stevens, 2019). However, the discussion is based on temperature anomaly time series instead of absolute temperatures because our focus is on evaluation of the simulation of climate change in these models, and also because anomalies are more uniformly distributed and are more easily deseasonalized to isolate long-term trends (see Section 1.4.1). CMIP6 models broadly reproduce surface temperature variations over the past millennium, including the cooling that follows periods of intense volcanism (medium confidence) (Figure 3.2c). Simulated GMST anomalies are well within the uncertainty range of temperature reconstructions (medium confidence) since about the year 1300, except for some short periods immediately following large volcanic eruptions, for which simulations driven by different forcing datasets disagree (Figure 3.2c). Before the year 1300, larger disagreements between models and temperature reconstructions are expected because forcing and temperature reconstructions are increasingly uncertain further back in time, but specific causes have not been identified conclusively (Ljungqvist et al., 2019; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019) (medium confidence). For the historical period, results for CMIP6 shown in Figure 3.4 suggest that the qualitative history of surface temperature increase is well reproduced, including the increase in warming rates beginning in the 1960s and the temporary cooling that follows large volcanic eruptions."
AR6_WG1_3_9,3,11,"7.3.3, and Figure 6.8; Andrews et al., 2020; Dittus et al., 2020; Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020). Papalexiou et al. (2020), Tokarska et al. (2020) and Stolpe et al. (2021) all report that CMIP6 models on average overestimate warming from the 1970s or 1980s to the 2010s, although quantitative conclusions depend on which observational dataset is compared against (see also Table 2.4). However, Figure 3.4, which includes a larger number of models than available to those studies, INDICates that the CMIP6 multi-model mean tracks observed warming better than the CMIP5 multi-model mean after the year 2000. The CMIP6 multi-model mean GSAT warming between 1850– 1900 and 2010–2019 and associated 5–95% range is 1.09 [0.66 to 1.64] °C. Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 assessed GSAT warming over the same period at 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21] °C. So some CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is smaller than the assessed observed range, and other CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is larger. That overestimated warming may be an early symptom of overestimated ECS in some CMIP6 models (Section 7.5.6; Meehl et al., 2020; Schlund et al., 2020), and has implications for projections of GSAT changes (Chapter 4; Liang et al., 2020; Nijsse et al., 2020; Tokarska et al., 2020; Ribes et al., 2021). In some models, a large ECS and a strong aerosol forcing lead to too large a mid-20th century cooling followed by overestimated warming rates in the late 20th century when aerosol emissions decrease (Golaz et al., 2019; Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020). Temperature biases are driven by both model physics and prescribed forcing, which is a challenge for model development."
AR6_WG1_3_10,3,14,"Interest in internal variability since the publication of AR5 stems in part from its importance in understanding the slower global surface temperature warming over the early 21st century (see Cross-Chapter Box 3.1). Evidence coming mostly from paleo studies is mixed on whether CMIP5 models underestimate decadal and multi-decadal variability in global mean temperature. Schurer et al. (2013) found good agreement between internal variability derived from paleo reconstructions, estimated as the fraction of variance that is not explained by forced responses, and modelled variability, although the subset of CMIP5 models they used may have been associated with larger variability than the full CMIP5 ensemble. PAGES 2k Consortium (2019) found that the largest 51-year trends in both reconstructions of global mean temperature and fully forced climate simulations over the period 850 to 1850 were almost identical. Zhu et al. (2019) showed agreement in the modelled and reconstructed temporal spectrum of global surface temperatures on annual to multi-millennial time scales. However, they suggest that decadal- to centennial variability is partly forced by slow orbital changes that predate the last millennium. This is consistent with Gebbie and Huybers (2019), who showed that the deep ocean has been out of equilibrium over that period. Laepple and Huybers (2014) found good agreement between modelled and proxy-derived decadal ocean temperature variability, but underestimates of variance by models by at least a factor of ten at centennial time scales because models underestimate the difference between the warm and cold periods of the last millennium. Parsons et al. (2020) found that some CMIP6 models exhibit much higher multi-decadal variability in GSAT than CMIP5 models, with INDICations that variability in these models"
AR6_WG1_3_11,3,15,"is also higher than that from proxy reconstructions. CMIP6 models may not share the underestimation by CMIP5 models of variability in decadal to multi-decadal modes of variability, such as Pacific Decadal Variability (Section 3.7.6; England et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2014; Schurer et al., 2015) and Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV), which may be partly forced, (see Section 3.7.7) but this assessment is limited by the small number of available studies. For the Southern Hemisphere, Hegerl et al. (2018) found an instance of internal variability in the early 20th century larger than that modelled, but INDICated that could be an observational issue. GSAT versus observed changes Friedman et al. (2020) found biases in interhemispheric SST contrast in some models that may be consistent with underestimated cooling after early-20th century eruptions or underestimated Pacific Decadal Variability, but could also be due to an imperfect separation between internal variability and forced signal in the observations. Figure 3.2c, updated from PAGES 2k Consortium (2019), compares modelled temperatures to reconstructions over the last millennium. It INDICates that models reproduce the observed variability well, at least for the time scales between 20 and 50 years that paleo reconstructions typically resolve and that the figure represents. In summary, decadal"
AR6_WG1_3_12,3,16,"The previous paragraph took an ensemble-mean view of model performance, but individual models disagree on unforced variability. Figure 3.6 illustrates the large differences in GSAT variability in unforced CMIP6 pre-industrial control simulations, following the method of Parsons et al. (2020). Surface temperatures in pre-industrial conditions are especially variable in the ten models highlighted in Figure 3.6a, and some models substantially exceed the variability seen in CMIP5 models (Parsons et al., 2020). Figure 3.6b shows that the distribution of warming trends simulated by CMIP6 models in historical simulations is clearly distinct from that simulated in unforced pre-industrial control simulations. Still, the unforced variability of the five most variable models approaches half that observed over the historical period under anthropogenically forced conditions (Figure 3.6c; Parsons et al., 2020; Ribes et al., 2021). For the Centre National de la Recherche Météorologique (CNRM) models, which are among the most variable, the large, low-frequency variability is attributed to strong simulated Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (Séférian et al., 2019; Voldoire et al., 2019b), which is difficult to rule out because of the short observational record (Section 3.7.7; Cassou et al., 2018). But, importantly, patterns of temperature variability simulated by even the most variable models differ from the pattern of forced temperature change (Parsons et al., 2020). Taken together, this discussion and Figures 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6 INDICate that the statistics of internal variability in models compare well in most cases to observational estimates and temperature proxy reconstructions, though some CMIP6 models appear to have higher multi-decadal variability than CMIP5 models or proxy reconstructions. When used in attribution studies, models with overestimated variability would increase estimated uncertainties and make results statistically conservative."
AR6_WG1_3_13,3,17,"In contrast, studies published since AR5 INDICate that closely constraining the separate contributions of greenhouse gas changes and aerosol changes to observed temperature changes remains challenging. Nonetheless, attribution of warming to greenhouse gas forcing has been found as early as the end of the 19th century (Schurer et al., 2014; Owens et al., 2017; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019). Hegerl et al. (2019) found that volcanism cooled global temperatures by about 0.1°C between 1870 and 1910, then a lack of volcanic activity warmed temperatures by about 0.1°C between 1910 and 1950, (b) (d) with anthropogenic aerosols cooling temperatures throughout the 20th century, especially between 1950 and 1980 when the estimated range of aerosol cooling was about 0.1°C to 0.5°C. Jones et al. (2016) attributed a warming of 0.87 to 1.22°C per century over the period 1906 to 2005 to greenhouse gases, partially offset by a cooling of −0.54°C to −0.22°C per century attributed to aerosols. But they also found that detection of the greenhouse gas or the aerosol signal often fails, because of uncertainties in modelled patterns of change and internal variability. That point is illustrated by Figure 3.7, which shows two- and three-way fingerprinting regression coefficients for 13 CMIP6 models and the corresponding attributable warming ranges, derived using HadCRUT4 (Gillett et al., 2021). Regression coefficients with an uncertainty range that includes zero mean that detection has failed. Models with regression coefficients significantly less than one significantly overpredict the temperature response to the corresponding forcing. Conversely, models with regression coefficients significantly greater than one underpredict the response to these forcings. While estimates of warming attributable to anthropogenic influence derived using individual models are generally consistent, estimates of warming"
AR6_WG1_3_14,3,22,"realistic SST simulation in the central and eastern Pacific show a better performance than other models. Though systematic biases still remain, this INDICates that the bias in tropospheric temperature warming in models is in part linked to surface temperature warming biases, especially in the lower troposphere."
AR6_WG1_3_15,3,23,"Upper stratospheric temperature changes were not assessed in the context of attribution or model evaluation in AR5, but this is an area where there has been considerable progress over recent years (Section 2.3.1.2.1). Simulated temperature changes in chemistry-climate models show good consistency with the reprocessed dataset from NOAA STAR but are less consistent with the revised UK Met Office record (Karpechko et al., 2018). The latter still shows stronger cooling than simulated in chemistry-climate models (Maycock et al., 2018). Reanalyses, which assimilate AMSU and SSU datasets, INDICate an upper-stratospheric cooling from 1979 to 2009 of about 3°C at 5 hPa and 4°C at 1 hPa that agrees well with the cooling in simulations with prescribed SST and using CMIP5 forcings (Simmons et al., 2014). Mitchell (2016) used regularized optimal fingerprinting techniques to carry out an attribution analysis of annual mid- to upper- stratospheric temperature in response to external forcings. They found that anthropogenic forcing has caused a cooling of approximately 2°C–3°C in the upper stratosphere over the period of 1979–2015, with greenhouse gases contributing two thirds of this change and ozone depletion contributing one third. They found a large upper-stratospheric temperature change in response to volcanic forcing (0.4°C–0.6°C for Mount Pinatubo) but that change is still smaller than the lower- stratospheric signal. Aquila et al. (2016) found that the cooling of the middle and upper stratosphere after 1979 is mainly due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Volcanic eruptions and the solar cycle were found not to affect long-term stratospheric temperature trends but to have short-term influences."
AR6_WG1_3_16,3,27,"Records of tree ring width have provided evidence that recent prolonged dry spells in the Levant and Chile are unprecedented in the last millennium (high confidence) (Cook et al., 2016a; Garreaud et al., 2017). East Africa has also been drying in recent decades (Rowell et al., 2015; Hoell et al., 2017), a trend that is unusual in the context of the sedimentary paleorecord spanning the last millennium (Tierney et al., 2015). This may be a signature of anthropogenic forcing but cannot yet be distinguished from natural variability (Hoell et al., 2017; Philip et al., 2018). Likewise, tree rings INDICate that the 2012–2014 drought in the south-western United States was exceptionally severe in the context of natural variability over the last millennium, and may have been exacerbated by the contribution of anthropogenic temperature rise (medium confidence) (Griffin and Anchukaitis, 2014; Williams et al., 2015). Furthermore, Williams et al. (2020) used a combination of hydrological modelling and tree-ring reconstructions to show that the period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest 19-year span in south- western North America since the late 1500s. Nonetheless, tree rings also INDICate the presence of prolonged megadroughts in western North America throughout the last millennium that were more severe than 20th and 21st century events (high confidence) (Cook et al., 2004, 2010, 2015). These were associated with internal variability (Coats et al., 2016; Cook et al., 2016b) and INDICate that large-magnitude changes in the water cycle may occur irrespective of anthropogenic influence (see also McKitrick and Christy, 2019).

In the zonal mean, the downwelling branch of the Hadley circulation cell is located in the subtropics and is often used as an INDICATOR of the meridional extent of the tropics. In the equatorial zonal-vertical section, the major rising branch of the Walker circulation is located over the Maritime continent with secondary ascending regions over northern South America and Africa. The zonal component of the surface trade winds over most of the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic is associated with the Walker circulation. This section assesses the zonal-mean Hadley cell extent and the Pacific Walker circulation strength. Regional and water cycle aspects of these circulations are assessed in more detail in Section 8.3.2."

Coats and Karnauskas (2017) also find that the anthropogenic influence on the SST gradient is yet to emerge out of internal variability even on centennial time scales."
AR6_WG1_3_21,3,38,"Trends since the 1980s in in-situ and satellite observations and reanalyses exhibit strengthening of the Pacific Walker circulation and SST gradient (Section 2.3.1.4.1 and Figure 3.16f; L’Heureux et al., 2013; Boisséson et al., 2014; England et al., 2014; Kociuba and Power, 2015; Ma and Zhou, 2016). AMIP simulations reproduce this strengthening (Figure 3.16d; Boisséson et al., 2014; Ma and Zhou, 2016), INDICating a dominant role of SST changes. However, all reanalysis trends lie outside the 5–95% range of simulated CMIP6 historical Walker circulation trends over this period (Figure 3.16f), consistent with CMIP5 results (England et al., 2014; Kociuba and Power, 2015). This may be in part caused by the underestimation of the PDV magnitude especially in CMIP5 models (Section 3.7.6; Kociuba and Power, 2015; Chung et al., 2019), but also suggests a potential error in simulating the"

Studies of last millennium simulations show that simulated global monsoon precipitation increases with global mean temperature, while changes in monsoon circulation and hemispheric monsoon precipitation depend on forcing sources (Liu et al., 2012; Chai et al., 2018).

Based on the large ensembles of CESM1 and CanESM2, the September Arctic sea ice extent variance first increases and then decreases as SIE declines from its pre-industrial value (Kirchmeier- Young et al., 2017; Mueller et al., 2018) consistent with previous work (Goosse et al., 2009), but neither study found a strong sensitivity of detection and attribution results to the change in variability. Further work has INDICated that internally-driven summer atmospheric circulation trends with enhanced atmospheric ridges over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean, which project on the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (Section 3.7.1), play an important role in the observed Arctic sea ice loss (Hanna et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2017). A fingerprint analysis using the CESM large ensemble suggests that this internal variability accounts for 40–50% of the observed September Arctic sea ice decline (Ding et al., 2019; England et al., 2019). Internally-generated decadal tropical variability and associated atmospheric teleconnections were suggested to have contributed to the changing atmospheric circulation in the Arctic and the associated rapid sea ice decline from 2000 to 2014 (Meehl et al., 2018). Some recent studies evaluated the human contribution to recent record minimum SIE events in the Arctic. Analysing CMIP5 simulations, Zhang and Knutson (2013) found that the observed 2012 record low in September Arctic SIE is inconsistent with internal climate variability alone. Based on several large ensembles, Kirchmeier-Young et al. (2017) concluded that the observed 2012 SIE minimum cannot be reproduced in a simulation excluding human influence. Fučkar et al. (2016) showed that climate change contributed to the record low March Arctic SIE in 2015, which was accompanied by the record minimum SIE in the Sea of Okhotsk (Paik et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_3_25,3,48,"that the observed trends since the mid-1960s are not inconsistent with model simulated trends. Studies based on the satellite period also INDICate that the observed trends are largely within the range of simulated internal variability (Hobbs et al., 2016). A few distinct factors that led to the weak signal-to-noise ratio in Antarctic SIE trends have been further identified, which include large multi-decadal variability (Monselesan et al., 2015), the short observational record (e.g., Abram et al., 2013), and the limited model performance at representing the complex Antarctic climate system as discussed above (Bintanja et al., 2013; Uotila et al., 2014). The short period of comprehensive satellite observations, beginning in 1979, makes it challenging to set the observed increase between 1979 and 2015, or the subsequent decrease, in a long-term context, and to assess whether the difference in trend between observations and models, which mostly simulate long-term decreases, is systematic or a rare expression of internal variability on decadal to multi-decadal time scales."

Models of Greenland Ice Sheet evolution are evaluated in detail in Section 9.4.1.2, which assesses that there is overall medium confidence in these models.

AR6_WG1_3_28,3,54,"In CMIP5, mean state biases in the tropical Pacific Ocean including the excessive equatorial cold tongue, erroneous mean thermocline depth and slope along the equator remained but were improved relative to CMIP3 (Flato et al., 2013). Misrepresentation of the interaction between the atmosphere and ocean via the Bjerknes feedback and vertical mixing parameterizations, and a bias in winds were among the suggested reasons for the persistent biases (Li et al., 2014; Zhu and Zhang, 2018). Moving to CMIP6, a reduction of the cold bias in the equatorial cold tongue in the central Pacific is found on average in the CMIP6 models (Figure 3.24b; Grose et al., 2020; Planton et al., 2021), however, this reduced bias is not statistically significant when considered across the multi-model ensemble (Planton et al., 2021). It is also noteworthy that the longitude of the 28°C isotherm is closer to observed in CMIP6 than in CMIP5, with a coincident reduction in the CMIP6 inter-model standard deviation (Grose et al., 2020). The latter result implies that there is an improvement in the representation of the tropical Pacific mean state in CMIP6 models. Comparison of biases in individual HighResMIP models with biases in lower resolution versions of the same models INDICates that there is no consistent improvement in SST biases in most of the equatorial Pacific with resolution (Figure 3.3e; Bock et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_3_29,3,60,"In an attribution study of the sea-level contributions of glaciers, Marzeion et al. (2014) found that between 1991 and 2010, the anthropogenic fraction of global glacier mass loss was 69 ± 24% (see also Section 3.4.3.1). Slangen et al. (2016) considered all quantifiable components of the GMSL budget and showed that anthropogenically forced changes account for 69 ± 31% of the observed sea level rise over the period 1970 to 2005, whereas natural forcings combined with internal variability have a much smaller effect – only contributing 9 ± 18% of the change over the same period. These studies INDICate that about 70% of the combined change in glaciers, ice-sheet surface mass balance and thermal expansion since 1970 can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing, and that this percentage has increased over the course of the 20th century. Detection studies on GMSL change in the 20th century (Becker et al., 2014; Dangendorf et al., 2015) found that observed total GMSL change in the 20th century was inconsistent with internal variability. Dangendorf et al. (2015) determined that for 1900 to 2011 at least 45% of GMSL change is human-induced. A study that developed a semi-empirical model to link sea-level change to observed GMST change concluded that at least 41% of the 20th century sea-level rise would not have happened in the absence of the century’s increasing GMST and that there was a 95% probability that by 1970 GMSL was higher than that which would have occurred in the absence of increasing GMST (Kopp et al., 2016). Richter et al. (2020) compared modelled sea level change with the satellite altimeter observations from 1993 to 2015; a period short enough that internal variability can dominate the spatial pattern of change. They found that when GMSL is not removed, model simulated zonally averaged sea level trends are consistent with altimeter observations globally as well as in each ocean basin and much larger than might be expected from internal variability. Using spatial correlation, Fasullo and Nerem (2018) showed that the satellite altimeter trend pattern is already detectable."
AR6_WG1_3_30,3,64,"This section considers three main large-scale INDICATORs of climate change relevant to the terrestrial carbon cycle: atmospheric CO concentration, atmosphere-land CO fluxes, and leaf area INDEX. These INDICATORs were chosen because they have been the target of attribution studies. Other INDICATORs, like land use and management, and wildfires, relate to human influence but are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 7 discusses energetic consequences of changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle in Section 7.4.2.5.2. CMIP5 and CMIP6 ESMs are most often run with prescribed observed historical changes in atmospheric CO concentration and diagnose CO emissions consistent with these. Such calculations require that the models simulate realistic changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle over the historical period, as changes to land carbon stores will influence the size of CO emissions consistent with prescribed CO pathways, and associated remaining carbon budgets (Section 5.5). Such testing of existing models is needed while also recognising there are process representations still requiring inclusion."
AR6_WG1_3_31,3,65,"Detection and attribution methods have been applied to leaf area INDEX, which represents ‘greenness’ and general photosynthetic productivity (see Section 2.3.4.3). Nitrogen deposition and land cover change trends remain small compared to variability, so attributing changes in leaf area INDEX to those processes is difficult. Using three satellite products and ten land models, Zhu et al. (2016) found increases in leaf area INDEX (greening) over 25–50% of global vegetated areas, and they attributed 70% of this greening to CO fertilization, although they found that land use change can dominate regionally. This is consistent with the attribution study of observed greening of Mao et al. (2016), and with Mao et al. (2013) who found that CO fertilization was the dominant cause of enhanced vegetation growth, with latitudinal changes in leaf area INDEX explained by the larger land surface warming in the Northern Hemisphere. These conclusions are also consistent with those of Zhu et al. (2017), who found a dominant role for CO fertilization in driving leaf area INDEX changes in an attribution study in which land models were first weighted by performance. However, Chen et al. (2019) has challenged these results by showing that greening in India and China was driven by land-use change."
AR6_WG1_3_32,3,65,"Leaf area INDEX increases attributed to CO fertilization are due to a direct raised physiological response. However, for drylands, CO -induced stomatal closure may act to conserve soil moisture and thereby indirectly drive higher photosynthesis through higher water use efficiency (Lu et al., 2016). In models with nitrogen deposition, there is evidence that this simulated effect also influences leaf area INDEX trends, however, because of a lack of literature based on large-scale land simulations including both nutrient limitation and crop intensification, it is not yet possible to make an attribution statement about their individual roles in leaf area INDEX changes."
AR6_WG1_3_33,3,67,"The Northern Annular Mode (NAM; also known as the Arctic Oscillation) is an oscillation of atmospheric mass between the Arctic and northern mid-latitudes, analogous to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM; Section 3.7.2). It is the leading mode of variability of sea-level pressure in the northern extratropics but also has a clear fingerprint through the troposphere up to the lower stratosphere, with maximum expression in boreal winter (Kidston et al., 2015). The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) can be interpreted as the regional expression of the NAM and captures most of the related variance in the troposphere over a broad North Atlantic/Europe domain. INDICES measuring the state of the NAO correlate highly with those of the NAM, and teleconnection patterns for both modes are rather similar (Feldstein and Franzke, 2006). A detailed description of the NAM and the NAO as well as their associated teleconnection over land is given in Annex IV.2.1."
AR6_WG1_3_34,3,67,"AR5 found that while models simulated correctly most of the spatial properties of the NAM, substantial inter-model differences remained in the details of the associated teleconnection patterns over land (Flato et al., 2013). The AR5 reported that most models did not reproduce the observed positive trend of the NAO/NAM INDICES during the second half of the 20th century. It was unclear to what extent this failure reflected model shortcomings and/or if the observed trend could be simply related to pronounced internal"
AR6_WG1_3_35,3,68,"The observed trend of the NAM and NAO INDICES is positive in winter when calculated from the 1960s (Section 2.4.1.1) but it includes large multi-decadal variability, which means that the nature of the trend should be interpreted with caution (Gillett et al., 2013). The multi-model multi-member ensemble mean of the trend estimated from historical simulations over that period is very close to zero for both CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Figures 3.33j,k and 3.34a). Even if one cannot rule out that 1958–2014 was an exceptional period of variability, the observational estimates of the wintertime NAO trend lie outside the 5th–95th percentile range of the distribution"
AR6_WG1_3_36,3,68,"In contrast to winter, the observed trend of the NAO INDEX over 1958–2014 is overall negative in summer and is associated with more recurrent blocking conditions over Greenland, in particular since the mid-1990s, thus contributing to the acceleration of melting of the Arctic sea ice (Section 3.4.1.1) and Greenland Ice Sheet (Section 3.4.3.2; Fettweis et al., 2013; Hanna et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2017). The origin of the negative trend of the summer NAO has not been clearly identified, and is hypothesized to be the result of combined influences (Lim et al., 2019), though trends in summertime NAO should also be interpreted with caution because of the presence of strong multi-decadal variability. The recent observed negative NAO prevalence and related blocking over Greenland is not present in any of the CMIP5 models (Hanna et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_3_37,3,70,"Based on the CMIP5 historical ensemble, Gillett and Fyfe (2013) however showed that such a trend is not significant in all seasons. A multi-model assessment of eight CMIP5 models found a NAM increase in response to greenhouse gases, but no robust influence of aerosol changes (Gillett et al., 2013). As for ozone depletion, there is no robust detectable influence on long-term trends of the NAO/NAM (Karpechko et al., 2018) in contrast to the SAM (Section 3.7.2), but there are INDICations that extreme Arctic ozone depletion events and their surface expression are linked to an anomalously strong NAM episodes (Calvo et al., 2015; Ivy et al., 2017). However, the direction of causality here is not clear."
AR6_WG1_3_38,3,71,"Despite new efforts since AR5 to reconstruct the NAO beyond the instrumental record, it is still very challenging to assess the role of external forcings in the apparent multi-decadal to centennial variability present throughout the last millennium. Large uncertainties remain in the reconstructed NAO INDEX that are sensitive to the types of proxies and statistical methods (Trouet et al., 2012; Ortega et al., 2015; Anchukaitis et al., 2019; Cook et al., 2019; Hernández et al., 2020; Michel et al., 2020) and reconstructed NAO variations are often not reproduced using pseudo-proxy approaches in models (Lehner et al., 2012; Landrum et al., 2013). At low frequency, it remains challenging to evaluate if the observed or reconstructed signal corresponds to an actual change in the NAO intraseasonal to interannual intrinsic properties or rather to a change in the mean background atmospheric circulation changes projecting on a specific phase of the mode. Consequently, conflicting results emerge in the attribution of reconstructed long-term variations in the NAO to solar forcing, whose influence thus remains controversial (Gómez-Navarro and Zorita, 2013; Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2015; Ait Brahim et al., 2018; Sjolte et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018). Influences from major volcanic eruptions appear to be more robust (Ortega et al., 2015; Swingedouw et al., 2017) even if some modelling experiments question the amplitude of the response, which mostly projects on the positive phase of the NAM/NAO (Bittner et al., 2016). The forced response is dependent on the strength, seasonal timing and location of the eruption but may also depend on the mean climate background state (Zanchettin et al., 2013) and/or the phases of the main modes of decadal variability such as the AMV (Section 3.7.7; Ménégoz et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_3_39,3,71,"The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) consists of a meridional redistribution of atmospheric mass around Antarctica (Figure 3.33c,f), associated with a meridional shift of the jet and surface westerlies over the Southern Ocean. SAM INDICES are variously defined as the difference in zonal-mean sea level pressure or geopotential height between middle and high latitudes or via a principal-component analysis (Annex IV.2.2). Observational aspects of the SAM are assessed in Section 2.4.1.2."
AR6_WG1_3_40,3,72,"to internal variability could be even lower (Figure 3.34b). Although paleo-reconstructions of the SAM INDEX are uncertain and vary in terms of long-term trends (Section 2.4.1.2), new reconstructions show that the 60-year summertime SAM trend since the mid-20th century is outside the 5th–95th percentile range of the trends in the pre-industrial variability, which matches the trend range of CMIP5 pre-industrial control simulations well (Dätwyler et al., 2018). In general agreement with AR5, new research continues to INDICate that both stratospheric ozone depletion and increasing greenhouse gases have contributed to the trend of the SAM during austral summer toward its positive phase in recent decades (Solomon and Polvani, 2016), with the ozone depletion influence dominating (Gerber and Son, 2014; Son et al., 2018). In CMIP6 historical simulations there are significant positive SAM trends over the 1979–2019 period in austral summer, although the contribution from ozone forcing evaluated with the four available models is not significant (Figure 3.34b). Three of these models share the same standard prescribed ozone forcing and produce significantly positive SAM trends over an extended period (1957–2019). The fourth model, MRI-ESM2-0, has the option of interactive ozone chemistry. Its ozone-only experiment is forced by prescribed ozone derived from its own historical simulations and produces a negative SAM trend associated with weak ozone depletion (Morgenstern et al., 2020). Morgenstern et al. (2014) and Morgenstern (2021) find an indirect influence of greenhouse gases on the SAM via induced ozone changes in coupled chemistry-climate simulations, which differ from the prescribed ozone simulations shown in Figure 3.34b. Since about 1997, the effective abundance of ozone- depleting halogen has been decreasing in the stratosphere (WMO, 2018), leading to a stabilization or even a reversal of stratospheric ozone depletion (Sections 2.2.5.2 and 6.3.2.2). The ozone stabilization and slight recovery since about 2000 may have caused a pause in the summertime SAM trend (Figure 3.34c; Saggioro and Shepherd, 2019; Banerjee et al., 2020), although some influence from internal variability cannot be ruled out. While some studies find an anthropogenic aerosol influence on the summertime SAM (Gillett et al., 2013; Rotstayn, 2013), recent studies with larger multi-model ensembles find that this effect is not robust (Steptoe et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2019), consistent with CMIP6 single forcing ensembles (Figure 3.34). In the CMIP5 simulations, volcanic stratospheric aerosol has a significant weakening effect on the SAM in autumn and winter (Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; Gillett and Fyfe, 2013), but there is no evidence that this effect leads to a significant multi-decadal trend since the late 20th century. Beyond external forcing, Fogt et al. (2017) show a significant association of tropical SST variability with the summertime SAM trend since the mid-20th century in agreement with Lim et al. (2016), who, however, demonstrate that such a teleconnection between the summertime SAM and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (Annex IV.2.3), found in observations, is missing in many CMIP5 models."
AR6_WG1_3_41,3,77,"To conclude, ENSO representation in CMIP5 models displayed a significant improvement from the representation of ENSO variability in CMIP3 models, which displayed much more intermodel spread in standard deviation, and stronger biennial periodicity (Guilyardi et al., 2012; Flato et al., 2013). In general, there has been no large step change in the representation of ENSO between CMIP5 and CMIP6, however, CMIP6 models appear to better represent some key ENSO characteristics (e.g., Brown et al., 2020; Planton et al., 2021). The instrumental record and paleo-proxy evidence through the Holocene all suggest that ENSO can display considerable modulations in amplitude, pattern and period (see also Section 2.4.2). For the period since 1850, there is no clear evidence for a sustained shift in ENSO INDEX beyond the range of internal variability. However, paleo-proxy evidence INDICates with medium confidence that ENSO variability since 1950 is greater than at any time between 1400 and 1850 (Section 2.4.2). Coupled models display large changes of ENSO behaviour in the absence of external forcing changes, and little-to-no variance sensitivity to historical anthropogenic forcing. Thus, there is low confidence that anthropogenic forcing has led to the changes of ENSO variability inferred from paleo-proxy evidence."
AR6_WG1_3_42,3,78,"The observed Indian Ocean basin-average SST increase on multi-decadal and centennial time scales is well represented by CMIP5 historical simulations, and has been attributed to the effects of greenhouse gases offset in part by the effects of anthropogenic aerosols mainly through aerosol-cloud interactions (Dong and Zhou, 2014; Dong et al., 2014b). The observed SST trend is larger in the western than eastern tropical Indian Ocean, which leads to an apparent upward trend of the IOD INDEX, but this trend is statistically insignificant (Section 2.4.3). CMIP5 models capture this warming pattern, which may be associated with Walker circulation weakening over the Indian Ocean due to greenhouse gas forcing (Dong and Zhou, 2014). However, strong internal decadal IOD-like variability and observational uncertainty preclude attribution (Cai et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014b; Gopika et al., 2020). Such a positive IOD-like change in equatorial zonal SST gradient suggests an increase in the frequency of extreme positive events (Cai et al., 2014) and skewness (Cowan et al., 2015) of the IOD mode. While there is some evidence of an increase in frequency of positive IOD events during the second half of the 20th century, the current level of IOD variability is not unprecedented in a proxy reconstruction for the last millennium (Section 2.4.3; Abram et al., 2020). Besides, the IOD magnitude in the late 20th century is not significantly different between CMIP5 simulations forced by historical and natural-only forcings, though this conclusion is based on only five selected ensemble members that realistically reproduce statistical features of the IOD (Blau and Ha, 2020). While selected CMIP5 models show weakening (Thielke and Mölg, 2019) and seasonality changes (Blau and Ha, 2020) in IOD-induced rainfall anomalies in tropical eastern Africa, no comparison with observational records has been made. Likewise, while a strengthening tendency of the ENSO-IOB mode correlation and resultant intensification of the IOB mode are found in historical or future simulations in selected CMIP5 models (Hu et al., 2014; Tao et al., 2015), such a change has not been detected in observational records."
AR6_WG1_3_43,3,78,"After linear detrending, Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV; Annex IV.2.6; Section 3.7.6) has been suggested as a driver of decadal to multi-decadal variations in the IOB mode (Dong et al., 2016). However, correlation between the PDV and a decadal IOB INDEX, defined from linearly detrended SST, changed from positive to negative during the 1980s (Han et al., 2014a). The increase in anthropogenic forcing and recovery from the eruptions of El Chichón in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991 may have overwhelmed the PDV influence, and explain this change (Dong and McPhaden, 2017; L. Zhang et al., 2018a). However, the low statistical degrees of freedom hamper clear detection of human influence in this correlation change."
AR6_WG1_3_44,3,79,"There are some recent INDICations that increasing model resolution both vertically and horizontally, in the ocean and atmospheric component (Richter, 2015; Small et al., 2015; Harlaß et al., 2018), could partly alleviate some tropical Atlantic biases in mean state (Section 3.5.1.2.2), seasonality, interannual- to decadal-variability and associated teleconnectivity over land, such as with the West African monsoon (Steinig et al., 2018). Results from CMIP6 tend to confirm that increasing resolution is not the unique way to address the biases in the tropical Atlantic (Richter and Tokinaga, 2020). For instance, the inclusion of a stochastic physics scheme has a nearly equivalent effect in the improvement of the mean number and the strength distribution of tropical Atlantic cyclones (Vidale et al., 2021)."
AR6_WG1_3_45,3,80,"Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) is the generic term for the modes of variability in the Pacific Ocean that vary on decadal to inter-decadal time scales. PDV and its related teleconnections encompass the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO; Mantua et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1997; Mantua and Hare, 2002), and an anomalous SST pattern in the North Pacific, as well as a broader structure associated with Pacific-wide SSTs termed the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO; Power et al., 1999; Folland et al., 2002; Henley et al., 2015). Since the PDO and IPO INDICES are highly correlated, this section assesses them together as the PDV (Annex IV.2.6)."
AR6_WG1_3_46,3,80,"Biases in the PDV temporal properties and amplitude are present in CMIP5 (Cheung et al., 2017; Henley, 2017). While model evaluation is severely hampered by short observational records and incomplete observational coverage before satellite measurements started, the duration of PDV phases appears to be shorter in coupled models than in observations, and correspondingly the ratio of decadal to interannual variance is underestimated (Figure 3.39e,f; Henley et al., 2017). This apparent bias may be associated with overly biennial behaviour of Pacific trade wind variability and related ENSO activity, leaving too weak variability on decadal time scales (Kociuba and Power, 2015). ENSO influence on the extratropical North Pacific Ocean at decadal time scales is also very diverse among both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, being controlled by multiple factors (Nidheesh et al., 2017). In terms of amplitude, the variance of the PDV INDEX after decadal filtering is significantly weaker in the concatenated CMIP5 ensemble than the three observational estimates used in Figure 3.39e (p <0.1 with an F-test). Consequently, the observed PDV fluctuations over the historical period often lie in the tails of the model distributions (Figure 3.39e,f). Even if one cannot rule out that the observed PDV over the instrumental era represents an exceptional period of variability, it is plausible that the tendency of the CMIP5 models to systematically underestimate the low frequency variance is due to an incomplete representation of decadal-scale mechanisms in these models. This situation is slightly improved in CMIP6 historical simulations but remains a concern (Fasullo et al., 2020). The results of McGregor et al. (2018) suggest that the under-representation of the variability stems from Atlantic mean SST biases (Section 3.5.1.2.2) through inter-basin coupling."
AR6_WG1_3_47,3,80,"While PDV is primarily understood as an internal mode of variability (Si and Hu, 2017), there are some INDICations that anthropogenically induced SST changes project onto PDV and have contributed to its past evolution (Bonfils and Santer, 2011; Dong et al., 2014a; Boo et al., 2015; Xu and Hu, 2018). However, the level of evidence is limited because of the difficulty in correctly separating internal versus externally forced components of the observed SST variations, and because it is unclear whether the dynamics of the PDV are operative in this forced SST change pattern. Over the last two to three decades which encompass the period of slower GMST increase (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1), Smith et al. (2016) found that anthropogenic aerosols have driven part of the PDV change toward its negative phase. A similar result is shown in Takahashi and Watanabe (2016) who found intensification of the Pacific Walker circulation in response to aerosol forcing (Section 3.3.3.1.2). Indeed, CMIP6 models simulate a negative PDV trend since the 1980s (Figure 3.39f), which is much weaker than internal variability. However, a response to anthropogenic aerosols is not robustly identified in a large ensemble of a model (Oudar et al., 2018), across CMIP5 models (Hua et al., 2018), or in idealized model simulations (Kuntz and Schrag, 2016). Alternatively, inter-basin teleconnections associated with the warming of the North Atlantic Ocean related to the mid-1990s phase shift of the AMV (McGregor et al., 2014; Chikamoto et al., 2016; Kucharski et al., 2016; X. Li et al., 2016a; Ruprich-Robert et al., 2017), and also warming in the Indian Ocean (Luo et al., 2012; Mochizuki et al., 2016), could have favoured a PDV transition to its negative phase in the 2000s. Considering the possible influence of external forcing on Indian Ocean decadal variability (Section 3.7.4) and AMV (Section 3.7.7), any such human influence on PDV would be indirect through changes in these ocean basins, and then imported to the Pacific via inter-basin coupling. However, this human influence on AMV, and how consistently such inter-basin"
AR6_WG1_3_48,3,81,"processes affect PDV phase shifts, are uncertain. Other modelling studies find that anthropogenic aerosols can influence the PDV (Verma et al., 2019; Amiri-Farahani et al., 2020; Dow et al., 2020). It is however unclear whether and how much those forcings contributed to the observed variations of PDV. In CMIP6 models, the temporal correlation of the multi-model ensemble mean PDV INDEX with its observational counterpart is insignificant and negligible (Figure 3.39f), suggesting that any externally-driven component in historical PDV variations was weak. Lastly, the multi-model ensemble mean computed from CMIP6 historical simulations shows slightly stronger variation than the CMIP5 counterpart, suggesting a greater simulated influence from external forcings in CMIP6. Still, the fraction of the forced signal to the total PDV is very low (Figure 3.39f), in contrast to AMV (Section 3.7.7). Consistently, Liguori et al. (2020) estimate that the variance fraction of"
AR6_WG1_3_49,3,82,"Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) refers to a climate mode representing basin-wide multi-decadal fluctuations in surface temperatures in the North Atlantic (Figure 3.40a,f), with teleconnections particularly pronounced over the adjacent continents and the Arctic. The AMV phenomenon is usually assessed through SST anomalies averaged over the entire North Atlantic basin, hereafter the AMV INDEX, but it is associated with many physical processes including three-dimensional ocean circulation, such as AMOC fluctuations (Section 3.5.4.1), gyre adjustments, and salt and heat transport in the entire North Atlantic and subarctic Atlantic basins. The AMV, together with the PDV, has been shown to have modulated GSAT on multi- decadal time scales since pre-industrial times (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1; T. Wu et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2020). A detailed description of the AMV as well as its associated teleconnection over land is given in Annex IV.2.7."
AR6_WG1_3_50,3,83,"There is additional evidence since AR5 that external forcing has been playing an important role in shaping the timing and intensity of the observed AMV since pre-industrial times (Bellomo et al., 2018; Andrews et al., 2020). The time synchronisation between observed and multi-model mean AMV SST INDICES is significant in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations, while the explained variance of the forced response in CMIP6 appears stronger (Figure 3.40d–f). The competition between greenhouse gas warming and anthropogenic sulphate aerosol cooling has been proposed to be particularly important over the latter half of the 20th century (Booth et al., 2012; Steinman et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2017; Undorf et al., 2018a; Haustein et al., 2019). The latest observed AMV shift from the cold to the warm phase in the mid-1990s at the surface ocean is well captured in the CMIP6 forced component and may be associated with"
AR6_WG1_3_51,3,84,"Model evaluation of the AMV phenomenon remains difficult because of short observational records (especially of detailed process-based observations), the lack of stationarity in the variance, spatial patterns and frequency of the AMV assessed from modelled SST (Qasmi et al., 2017), difficulties in estimating the forced signals in both historical simulations and observations (Tandon and Kushner, 2015), and because of probable interplay between internally and externally-driven processes (Watanabe and Tatebe, 2019). Furthermore, models simulate a large range of historical anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Smith et al., 2020) and questions often referred to as signal-to-noise paradox have been raised concerning the models’ ability to correctly simulate the magnitude of the response of AMV-related atmospheric circulation phenomena, such as the NAO (Section 3.7.1), to both internally and externally generated changes (Scaife and Smith, 2018). Related methodological and epistemological uncertainties also call into question the relevance of the traditional basin-average SST INDEX to assessing the AMV phenomenon (Zanchettin et al., 2014; Frajka-Williams et al., 2017; Haustein et al., 2019; Wills et al., 2019). To summarize, results from CMIP5 and CMIP6 models together with new statistical techniques to evaluate the forced component of modelled and observed AMV, provide robust evidence that external forcings have modulated AMV over the historical period. In particular, anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols are thought to have played a role in the timing and intensity of the negative (cold) phase of AMV recorded from the mid-1960s to mid-1990s and subsequent warming (medium confidence). However, there is low confidence in the estimated magnitude of the human influence. The limited level of confidence is primarily explained by difficulties in accurately evaluating model performance in simulating AMV. The evaluation is severely hampered by short instrumental records but also, equally importantly, by the lack of detailed and coherent long-term process-based observations (for example of the AMOC, aerosol optical depth, surface fluxes and cloud changes), which limit our process understanding. In addition, studies often rely solely on simplistic SST INDICES that may be hard to interpret (Zhang et al., 2016) and may mask critical physical inconsistencies in simulations of the AMV compared to observations (Zhang, 2017)."
AR6_WG1_3_52,3,84,"As might be expected from a warming atmosphere, moisture in the troposphere has increased and precipitation patterns have changed. Human influence has likely contributed to the observed changes in humidity and precipitation (Section 3.3.2). It is likely that human influence, in particular due to greenhouse gas forcing, is the main driver of the observed intensification of heavy precipitation in global land regions during recent decades (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2). The pattern of ocean salinity changes INDICate that fresh regions are becoming fresher and that salty regions are becoming saltier as a result of changes in ocean-atmosphere fluxes through evaporation and precipitation (high confidence) making it extremely likely that human influence has contributed to observed near-surface and subsurface salinity changes since the mid-20th century (Section 3.5.2.2). Taken together, this evidence INDICates a human influence on the water cycle."
AR6_WG1_3_53,3,86,"The purpose of this section is to use multivariate analyses to address how well models simulate present-day and historical climate. For every diagnostic field considered, model performance is compared to one or multiple observational references, and the quality of the simulation is expressed as a single number, for example a correlation coefficient or a root mean square difference versus the observational reference. By simultaneously assessing different performance INDICES, model improvements can be quantified, similarities in behaviour between different models become apparent, and dependencies between various INDICES become evident (Gleckler et al., 2008; Waugh and Eyring, 2008)."
AR6_WG1_3_54,3,86,"The type of multi-variate analysis of models presented in AR5 remains critical to building confidence for example in projections of climate change. It is expanded here to the previous-generation CMIP3 and present-generation CMIP6 models and also to more variables and more climate domains, covering land and ocean as well as sea ice. The multi-variate evaluation of these three generations of models is performed relative to the observational datasets listed in Annex I, Table AI.1. For many of these datasets, a rigorous characterization of the observational uncertainty is not available, see discussion in Chapter 2. Here, as much as possible, multiple independent observational datasets are used. Disagreements among them would cause differences in model scoring, INDICating that observational uncertainties may be substantial compared to model errors. Conversely, similar scores against different observational datasets would suggest model biases may be larger than the observational uncertainty."
AR6_WG1_3_55,3,86,"An analysis of a basket of 16 atmospheric variables (Figure 3.42a) assessed across CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models but excluding high-resolution models participating in HighResMIP, reveals the progress made between these three generations of models (Bock et al., 2020). Progress is evidenced by the increasing prevalence of blue colours (INDICating a performance better than the median) for the more recent model versions. Additionally, a few CMIP6 models outperform the best-performing CMIP5 models. Progress is evident across all 16 variables. As noted in AR5, the models typically score similarly against both observational reference datasets, INDICating that indeed uncertainties in these reference datasets are smaller than model biases. Several models and model families perform better compared to observational references than the median, across a majority of the climate variables assessed, and conversely some other models or model families compare more poorly against these reference datasets. Such a good correspondence across a range of diagnostic fields probing different aspects of climate enhances confidence that the improved performances reflect progress in the physical realism of these simulations. An alternative explanation, that progress is due to a cancellation of errors achieved by model tuning, appears improbable given the large number of diagnostic fields involved here. However, several instances of poor model performance (red colours in Figure 3.42) still exist in the CMIP6 ensemble. Family relationships (i.e. various degrees of shared formulations; Knutti et al., 2013) between the models are apparent, for example, the GISS, GFDL, CESM, CNRM, and HadGEM/UKESM1/ ACCESS families score similarly across all atmospheric variables, both for the CMIP5 and CMIP6 generations. In the cases of CESM2/ CESM2(WACCM), CNRM-CM6-1/CNRM-ESM2-1, NorCPM1/ NorESM2-LM, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL/UKESM1-0-LL, the high- complexity model scores as well or better than its lower-complexity counterpart, INDICating that increasing complexity by adding Earth system features, which by removing constraints could be expected to degrade a model’s performance, does not necessarily do so. Several high climate-sensitivity models (Section 7.5; Meehl et al., 2020), in particular CanESM5, CESM2, CESM2-WACCM, HadGEM3-GC31-LL, and UKESM1-0-LL, score well against the benchmarks. In accordance with AR5 and earlier assessments, the multi-model mean, with some notable exceptions, is better than any individual model (Annan and Hargreaves, 2011; Rougier, 2016)."
AR6_WG1_3_56,3,88,"In summary, CMIP6 models perform generally better for a basket of variables covering mean historical climate across the atmosphere, ocean, and land domains than previous-generation and older models (high confidence). Earth System models characterized by additional biogeochemical feedbacks often perform at least as well as related more constrained, lower-complexity models lacking these feedbacks (medium confidence). In many cases, the models score similarly against both observational references, INDICating that model errors are usually larger than observational uncertainties (high confidence). Moreover, synthesizing across Sections 3.3–3.7, we assess that the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed climate change well (high confidence). Using centred pattern correlations (quantifying pattern similarity on a scale of –1 to 1, with 1 expressing perfect similarity and 0 no relationship) for selected fields, AR5 documented improvements between CMIP3 and CMIP5 in surface air temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, and precipitation (Figure 9.6 of Flato et al., 2013). Little further progress between CMIP3 and CMIP5 was found for fields that were already quite well simulated in CMIP3 (such as surface air temperature and outgoing longwave radiation). For precipitation, the spread reduced because the worst-performing models improved. The shortwave cloud radiative effect remained relatively poorly simulated with significant inter-model spread (e.g., Calisto et al., 2014). This comparison of centred pattern correlations is designed to help determine the quality of simulation of different diagnostics relative to each other, and also to examine progress between generations of models. Figure 3.43 shows the centred pattern correlations for 16 variables for CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. In the ensemble averages, CMIP6 performs better than CMIP5 and CMIP3 for near-surface temperature, precipitation, mean sea-level pressure, and many other variables. For the variables shown, the uncertainties in observational datasets, in particular for Pattern correlation with observational reference correlation precipitation and northward wind at 850 hPa, remain substantial relative to mean model errors (see grey dots in Figure 3.43)."
AR6_WG1_3_57,3,90,"17 PMIP4 models completed Last Interglacial simulations (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2021). The comparison to reconstructions is generally good, except for some discrepancies, such as for upwelling systems in the South East Atlantic or discrepancies which may result from local melting of remnant ice sheets absent in the Last Interglacial simulation protocol. All models simulate a decrease in Arctic sea ice in summer, commensurate with increased summer insolation, while some models even simulate a large or complete loss (Guarino et al., 2020; Kageyama et al., 2021b). Sea ice reconstructions for the central Arctic are, however, too uncertain to evaluate this behaviour. The Last Interglacial simulations INDICate a clear relationship between simulated sea ice loss and model responses to increased greenhouse gas forcing (Kageyama et al., 2021b; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2021)."
AR6_WG1_3_58,3,92,"In summary, both high-resolution and high-complexity models have been evaluated as part of CMIP6. In comparison with standard resolution CMIP6 models, higher resolution probed under the HighResMIP activity (Haarsma et al., 2016) improves aspects of the simulation of climate (particularly concerning sea surface temperature) but discrepancies remain and there are some regions, such as parts of the Southern Ocean, where currently attainable resolution produces inferior performance (high confidence). Such model behaviour can INDICate deficiencies in model physics that are not simply associated with resolution. In several cases, high-complexity ESMs that include additional interactions between Earth system components and thus have potential for additional associated model errors nevertheless perform as well as their low-complexity counterparts, illustrating that interactively simulating these Earth System components as part of the climate system is now well established."
AR6_WG1_4_1,4,7,"This chapter assesses simulations of future climate change, covering both near-term and long-term global changes. The chapter assesses simulations of physical INDICATORs of global climate change, such as global surface air temperature (GSAT), global land precipitation, Arctic sea ice area (SIA), and global mean sea level (GMSL). Furthermore, the chapter covers INDICES and patterns of properties and circulation not only for mean fields but also for modes of variability that have global significance. The choice of quantities to be assessed is summarized in Cross-Chapter Box 2.2 and comprises a subset of the quantities covered in Chapters 2 and 3. This chapter provides consistent coverage from near-term to long-term global changes and provides the global reference for the later chapters covering important processes and regional change."
AR6_WG1_4_2,4,8,"Chapter 4: Future global climate The chapter is organized as follows (Figure 4.1). After Section 4.2 on the methodologies used in the assessment, Section 4.3 assesses projected changes in key global climate INDICATORs throughout the 21st century, relative to the period 1995–2014, which comprises the last 20 years of the historical simulations of CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) and hence the most recent past simulated with the observed atmospheric composition. The global climate INDICATORs assessed include GSAT, global land precipitation, Arctic sea ice area (SIA), global mean sea level (GMSL), the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), global mean ocean surface pH, carbon uptake by land and ocean, the global monsoon, the Northern and Southern Annular Modes (NAM and SAM), and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Differently from the assessment for changes in other quantities only based on the range of CMIP6 projections, additional lines of evidence enter the assessment for GSAT and GMSL change. For most results and figures based on CMIP6, one realization from each model (the first of the uploaded set) is used. Section 4.3 finally synthesizes the assessment of GSAT change using multiple lines of evidence in addition to the CMIP6 projection simulations."
AR6_WG1_4_3,4,8,"Section 4.4 covers near-term climate change, defined here as the period 2021–2040 and taken relative to the period 1995–2014. Section 4.4 focuses on global and large-scale climate INDICATORs, including precipitation and circulation INDICES and selected modes of variability (see Cross-Chapter Box 2.2 and Annex IV: Modes of Variability), as well as on the spatial distribution of warming. The potential roles of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) and volcanic eruptions on near-term climate change are also discussed. Chapter 4: Quick guide Section 4.4 synthesizes information from initialized predictions and non-initialized projections for the near-term change."
AR6_WG1_4_4,4,8,"Section 4.5 then covers mid-term and long-term climate change, defined here as the periods 2041–2060 and 2081–2100, respectively, again relative to the period 1995–2014. The mid-term period is thus chosen as the twenty-year period following the short-term period and straddling the mid-century point, year 2050; it is during the mid-term that differences between scenarios are expected to emerge against internal variability. The long-term period is defined, as in AR5, as the 20-year period at the end of the century. Section 4.5 assesses the same set of INDICATORs as Section 4.4, as well as changes in internal variability and in large-scale patterns, both of which are expected to emerge in the mid- to long-term. The chapter sub-division according to time slices (near term, mid-term, and long term) is thus to a large extent motivated by the different roles that internal variability plays in each period, compared to the expected forced climate-change signal."

AR6_WG1_4_6,4,12,"In summary, despite challenges (Cassou et al., 2018), there is high confidence that initialized predictions contribute information to near-term climate change for some regions over multi-annual to decadal time scales. Furthermore, there are INDICations that initialized predictions can constrain near-term projections (Befort et al., 2020). The clearest improvements through initialization are seen in the North Atlantic and related phenomena such as hurricane frequency, Sahel and European rainfall.

By contrast, the slow response in precipitation change is independent of the forcing. This INDICates that pattern scaling is not expected to work well for climate variables that have"
AR6_WG1_4_8,4,14,"The AR5 assessed with very high confidence that climate models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period, including the more rapid warming in the second half of the 20th century, and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions. Furthermore, because climate and Earth system models are based on physical principles, they were assessed in AR5 to reproduce many important aspects of observed climate. Both aspects were argued to contribute to our confidence in the models’ suitability for their application in quantitative future predictions and projections (Flato et al., 2013). This Report assesses (in Section 3.8.2) with high confidence that for most large-scale INDICATORs of climate change, the recent mean climate simulated by the latest generation climate models underpinning this assessment has improved compared to the models assessed in AR5, and with high confidence that the multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed climate change well. These assessments form the foundation of applying climate and Earth system models to the projections assessed in this chapter.

AR6_WG1_4_11,4,18,"This section assesses the latest simulations of representative INDICATORs of global climate change presented as time series and tabulated values over the 21st century and across the main realms of the global climate system. In the atmospheric realm (Section 4.3.1), we assess simulations of GSAT (Figure 4.2a) and global land precipitation (Figure 4.2b). Across the cryospheric, oceanic, and biospheric realms (Section 4.3.2), we assess simulations of Arctic SIA (Figure 4.2c), GMSL (Figure 4.2d), the AMOC, ocean and land carbon uptake, and pH. In Section 4.3.3 we assess simulations of several INDICES of climate variability, namely, the INDICES of the NAM, SAM, and ENSO. Finally, Section 4.3.4 assesses future GSAT change based on the CMIP6 ensemble in combination with other lines of evidence. An assessment of projected changes in related global extreme INDICES can be found in Chapter 11. From the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble we consider historical simulations with observed external forcings to 2014 and extensions to 2100 based on the five high-priority scenarios. We use the first realization (‘r1’) contributed by each modelling group. In tabular form, we show ensemble-mean changes and uncertainties for the near-term (2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060), and the long-term (2081–2100), relative to present-day (1995–2014) and the approximation to pre-industrial (1850–1900). Changes in precipitation over land near 1.5°C, 2.0°C, 3.0°C, and 4.0°C of global warming relative to 1850–1900 are also assessed."
AR6_WG1_4_12,4,26,"The Northern Annular Mode (NAM) is the leading mode of variability in the NH extratropical atmosphere (Section AIV.2.1). Throughout this chapter, we use a simple fixed latitude-based NAM INDEX defined as the difference in SLP between 35°N and 65°N (Section AIV.2.1; Li and Wang, 2003). The NAM INDEX computed from the latitudinal gradient in SLP is strongly correlated with variations in the latitudinal position and strength of the mid-latitude westerly jets, and with the spatial distribution of Arctic sea ice (Caian et al., 2018). Projected changes in the position and strength of the mid-latitude westerly jets, storm tracks, and atmospheric blocking in both hemispheres are assessed in Section 4.5.1.6. The AR5 referred to the NAM, and its synonym the Arctic Oscillation (AO), through its regional counterpart, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Here, we use the term NAM to refer also to the AO and NAO (Section AIV.2.1), accepting that the AO and NAO are not identical entities. We first summarize the assessment of past NAM changes and their attribution from Chapters 2 and 3 to put into context the future projections described here. Strong positive trends for the NAM/NAO INDICES were observed since 1960, which have weakened since the 1990s (high confidence) (Section 2.4.1.1). The NAO variability in the instrumental record was likely not unusual in the millennial and multi-centennial context (Section 2.4.1.1). Climate models simulate the gross features of the NAM with reasonable fidelity, including its interannual variability, but models tend to systematically underestimate the amount of multi-decadal variability of the NAM and jet stream compared to observations (Section 3.7.1; J.

A realistic simulation of the stratosphere and SST variability in the tropics and northern extratropics are important for a model to realistically capture the observed NAM variability. Despite some evidence from climate model studies that anthropogenic forcings influence the NAM, there is limited evidence for a significant role for anthropogenic forcings in driving the observed multi-decadal variations of the NAM over the instrumental period (Section 3.7.1). The AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that the future boreal wintertime NAM is very likely to exhibit large natural variations and trends of similar magnitude to that observed in the past and is likely to become slightly more positive in the future (Collins et al., 2013). Based on CMIP6 model results displayed in Figure 4.9a, we conclude that the boreal wintertime surface NAM is more positive by the end of the 21st century under SSP3‑7.0 and SSP5‑8.5 (high confidence). For these high emissions scenarios, the 5–95% range of NAM INDEX anomalies averaged from 2081–2100 are 0.3–3.8 hPa and 0.32–5.2 hPa, respectively. On the other hand, under neither of the lowest emissions scenarios, SSP1‑1.9 and SSP1‑2.6, does the NAM show a robust change, by the end of the 21st century (high confidence)."
AR6_WG1_4_14,4,27,"The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of large-scale extratropical atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere and influences most of the southern extratropics (Annex IV, Section AIV.2.2). In its positive phase, the SAM characterizes anomalously low pressure over the polar cap and high pressure in southern mid-latitudes (Marshall, 2003). While there are some zonal asymmetries to the structure of the SAM (Section AIV.2.2), it is more symmetric than its NH counterpart (Fyfe et al., 1999). Throughout this chapter, we use a simple fixed latitude-based SAM INDEX defined as the difference in zonal mean SLP between 40°S and 65°S (Gong and Wang, 1999; see Section AIV.2.2 for discussion of other SAM INDICES). Although the SAM is often used as a proxy for the location of the mid-latitude westerly wind belt, trends in the SAM can reflect a combination of changes in jet position, width, and strength. The changes in the Southern Hemisphere circulation associated with the SAM influence surface wind stress (Wang et al., 2014) and hence affect the Southern Ocean."

There is high confidence that stratospheric ozone depletion and GHG increases have contributed to the positive SAM trend during the late 20th century, with ozone depletion dominating in austral summer, following the peak of the Antarctic ozone hole in September –October, and GHG increases dominating in other seasons (Section 3.7.2).

AR6_WG1_4_16,4,27,"Among a range of INDICES proposed for representing ENSO, we use the most prominent one, the Niño 3.4 INDEX, defined as the average equatorial SST or precipitation across the central equatorial Pacific (5°S–5°N, 170°W–120°W; Section AIV.2.3). Here, we consider the evolution of the amplitude of Niño 3.4 INDEX for SST and precipitation over the 21st century as projected by CMIP6 models. Analysis of CMIP6 models shows there is no robust model consensus on the forced changes in the amplitude of ENSO SST variability even under the high-emissions scenarios SSP3‑7.0 and SSP5‑8.5, but a significant increasing trend in the amplitude of ENSO precipitation variability is projected across the 21st century in the four SSPs (Figure 4.10). This is broadly consistent with results from CMIP5 models (Christensen et al., 2013; Power et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017; Wengel et al., 2018), recent studies with CMIP6 models (Brown et al., 2020; Fredriksen et al., 2020; Freund et al., 2020; Yun et al., 2021), and large initial-condition ensemble experiments (Maher et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018; Haszpra et al., 2020)."

The AR5 further assessed that it is more likely than not that the mean GSAT for the period 2016–2035 will be more than 1°C above the mean for 1850–1900, and it is very unlikely that it will be more than 1.5°C above the 1850–1900 mean (medium confidence). It was shown that in the period 2016–2035, differences in GSAT across RCP scenarios for a single climate model are typically smaller than differences between climate models under a single RCP scenario, INDICating that model structural uncertainty is larger than scenario uncertainty over that period (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009)."
AR6_WG1_4_18,4,34,"The global land monsoon precipitation INDEX, defined as the area- weighted precipitation rate in the global land monsoon domain, tends to increase in the near term under all five core SSPs (Figure 4.14a) (Chen et al., 2020), but changes are small compared to the intermodel spread in the historical period. The Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon circulation INDEX, defined as the vertical shear of zonal winds between 850 and 200 hPa averaged in a zone stretching from Mexico eastward to the Philippines (0°–20°N, 120°W–120°E), tends to decrease under four of the five SSP scenarios (Figure 4.14b), potentially offsetting monsoon precipitation increase. Projected changes in the global monsoon circulation are also uncertain, because they are influenced by internal variability such as AMV and PDV (see Section 3.3.3.2) and structural differences across models. In the near-term, for CMIP6 projections (Figure 4.14a), the multi-model mean (5–95% range) of global land monsoon precipitation change is 1.9% (–0.4 to 4.9%), 1.6% (–1.0 to 5.2%), 1.3% (–1.7 to 3.7%), and 1.9% (–0.8 to 5.2%) under SSP1‑2.6, SSP2‑4.5, SSP3‑7.0, and SSP5‑8.5, respectively."

A tendency in the near term towards a slightly more positive NAM in the three highest emissions scenarios during boreal fall, winter, and spring is apparent in Figure 4.17a. However, in general the projected near- term multi-model mean change in the NAM is small in magnitude compared to the inter-model and/or multi-realization variability within the ensemble (Figure 4.17a; Deser et al., 2012b, 2017; Barnes and Polvani, 2015)."

Observational evidence since AR5 shows the onset of Antarctic ozone hole recovery (Solomon et al., 2016; WMO, 2018) that has been attributed to a pause in the summer SAM trend over the past couple of decades (Saggioro and Shepherd, 2019; Banerjee et al., 2020). In austral summer, ozone recovery and increasing GHGs will have opposing effects on the SAM over the next several decades (Barnes et al., 2014). Since AR5, there have been advances in understanding the role of internal climate variability for projected near-term SH circulation trends (Solomon and Polvani, 2016). A large initial-condition ensemble following the RCP4.5 emissions scenario shows a monotonic positive SAM trend in austral winter. In austral summer, the SAM trend over the first half of the 21st century is weaker compared to the strongly positive trend observed and simulated over the late 20th century. In that model, the number of realizations required to identify a detectable change in decadal mean austral winter SAM INDEX from a year 2000 reference state decreased to below five by around 2025–2030 (Solomon and Polvani, 2016). However, in December – January–February (DJF) the same criterion is not met until the second half of the 21st century, owing to the near-term opposing effects of ozone recovery and GHGs on the austral-summer SAM. In austral summer, forced changes in the SAM INDEX in the near-term are therefore likely to be smaller than changes due to internal variability (Figure 4.17b; Barnes et al., 2014; Solomon and Polvani, 2016)."

However, detection of robust near-term changes of ENSO SST variability in response to anthropogenic forcing is difficult to achieve due to pronounced unforced low-frequency modulations of ENSO (Wittenberg, 2009; Maher et al., 2018; Wengel et al., 2018). Figure 4.10 in Section 4.3.3.2, using CMIP6 models, also shows no robust change in ENSO SST variability in the near term."
AR6_WG1_4_24,4,38,"Climate variability of the Pacific Ocean on decadal and inter-decadal time scales is described in terms of a number of quasi-oscillatory SST patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO; Mantua et al., 1997) and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO; Folland, 2002), which are referred to as the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV; Newman et al., 2016). PDV comprises an inter-hemispheric pattern that varies at decadal to inter-decadal time scales (Figure 3.35). However, although the spatial domains to derive the IPO and PDO INDICES differ, and despite uncertainty related to trend removal and time-filtering (Newman et al., 2016; Tung et al., 2019), the IPO and PDO are highly correlated in time and they will be assessed together as the PDV (Annex IV, Section AIV.2.6). The AR5 assessed that near-term predictions of PDV (then referred to as PDO or IPO) were largely model dependent (Mochizuki et al., 2012; van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), not robust to sampling of initialization start-dates, overall not statistically significant, and worse than persistence (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013), although some studies showed positive skill for PDV (Mochizuki et al., 2010; Chikamoto et al., 2013). The CMIP5 decadal-prediction ensemble yielded no prediction skill of SST over the key PDV centres of action in the Pacific Ocean, both at two-to-five-year and six-to-nine-year forecast averages (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013; Guemas et al., 2013; Boer and Sospedra-Alfonso, 2019)."

The patterns of change in any given future period represent a combination of unforced internal variability and a forced response including their interaction (Deser et al., 2016). The role of internal variability is much larger at the local to regional scale than in the global mean projections. We here assess multi-model mean patterns based on CMIP6 models without any weighting or emergent constraints. The mean represents an estimate of the forced response and is a more homogeneous pattern than the 20-year mean change patterns in any individual model realization (Knutti et al., 2010)."
AR6_WG1_4_30,4,45,"Climate models project a weaker polar amplification in the SH than in the NH under transient warming (Figure 4.19). Model simulations (Hall, 2004; Danabasoglu and Gent, 2009; Li et al., 2013) and paleoclimate proxies INDICate polar amplification in both hemispheres near equilibrium, but generally with less warming in the Antarctic than the Arctic (Section 7.4.4.1.2). The primary driver of delayed warming of the southern high latitudes is the upwelling in the Southern Ocean and associated ocean heat uptake that is then transported away from Antarctica by northward flowing surface waters (Frölicher et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2015; Armour et al., 2016; W. Liu et al., 2018), although asymmetries in feedbacks between the poles also play a role (Section 7.4.4.1.1). Changes in westerly surface winds over the Southern Ocean have the potential to affect the rate of sea-surface warming, but there is currently low confidence in even the sign of the effect based on a diverse range of climate model responses to wind changes (Marshall et al., 2014; Ferreira et al., 2015; Kostov et al., 2017; Seviour et al., 2019). A substantial increase in freshwater input to the ocean from the Antarctic ice sheet could further slow the emergence of SH polar amplification by cooling the Southern Ocean surface (Bronselaer et al., 2018; Golledge et al., 2019; Schloesser et al., 2019), but this process is not represented in current climate models which lack dynamic ice sheets. Thus, while there is high confidence that the SH high latitudes will warm by more than the tropics on centennial time scales, there is low confidence that such a feature will emerge this century (Section 7.4.4.1)."
AR6_WG1_4_31,4,49,"The AR5 assessed that changes in mean precipitation in a warmer world will exhibit substantial spatial variation. Also, the contrast of mean precipitation between dry and wet regions and between dry and wet seasons will increase over most of globe as temperatures increase. The general pattern of change INDICates that high latitude land masses are likely to experience greater amounts of precipitation due to the increased specific humidity of the warmer troposphere as well as increased transport of water vapour from the tropics by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Many mid-latitude and subtropical arid and semi-arid regions will likely experience less precipitation, while many moist mid-latitude regions will likely experience more precipitation by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario."

This enhancement is caused by thermodynamic responses due to increased moisture, which is partly offset by dynamic responses due to a weakened circulation (Chen et al., 2020). The patterns of monsoon rainfall change in the mid- to long-term include a north–south asymmetry characterized by greater increase in the NH than the SH, and an East–West asymmetry characterized by enhanced Asian-African monsoons and weakened North American monsoon (medium confidence) (Lee and Wang, 2014; Mohtadi et al., 2016; Pascale et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021)."
AR6_WG1_4_33,4,51,"4.5.1.6.1 Sea level pressure The AR5 assessed that mean sea level pressure is projected to decrease in high latitudes and to increase in mid-latitudes. Such a pattern is associated with a poleward shift in the storm track and an increase in the annular mode INDEX. This broad pattern is also found in CMIP6 models (Figure 4.25). Under SSP1‑2.6, the pattern in sea level pressure change resembles that for SSP3‑7.0, but the amplitudes are small compared to internal variability in 20-year means (Figure 4.25). One exception is found in the SH mid-latitudes, where pressure robustly increases in SSP3‑7.0 in both austral summer and winter, but shows no robust change in SSP1‑2.6. This is likely attributable to the larger GHG forcing in SSP3‑7.0 compared to SSP1‑2.6, which contributes to a poleward shift of the SH mid-latitude circulation and becomes relatively more important than the effect of ozone recovery which drives an equatorward shift in the circulation (see Section 4.5.3.1 on the Southern Annular Mode; Barnes and Polvani, 2013; Barnes et al., 2014; Bracegirdle et al., 2020b). The poleward shift in SH mid-latitude circulation in SSP3‑7.0 likely contributes to the wetting trend at high southern latitudes (Figure 4.25). As was found in AR5, several regional sea level pressure features stand out from the zonal-mean change. Sea level pressure markedly decreases in north-eastern North America and north-eastern Asia in boreal winter. In boreal summer, sea level pressure robustly decreases"

Simulations INDICate that most of the changes in winter storminess over the Euro-Atlantic region will occur only after exceeding the 1.5°C warming level (Barcikowska et al., 2018). Progress since AR5 has improved understanding of the climate change aspects that can drive these different, and potentially opposite, responses in the mid-latitude jets and storm tracks. A poleward shift of the jets and storm tracks is expected in response to an increase in the atmospheric stratification and in the upper-tropospheric equator-to-pole meridional temperature gradient, while it is opposed by the decrease in the meridional temperature gradient in the lower troposphere associated with the polar amplification of global warming (Harvey et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 2016). Recent analyses have identified additional climate aspects that can drive mid-latitude jet changes, including patterns in sea surface warming (Mizuta et al., 2014; Langenbrunner et al., 2015; Ceppi et al., 2018; Wood et al., 2020), land–sea warming contrast (Shaw and Voigt, 2015), loss of sea ice (Deser et al., 2015; Harvey et al., 2015; Screen et al., 2018b; Zappa et al., 2018), and changes in the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex (Manzini et al., 2014; Grise and Polvani, 2017; Simpson et al., 2018; Ceppi and Shepherd, 2019). From an energetics perspective, the uncertainty in the response of the jet streams depends on the response of clouds, their non-spatially uniform radiative feedbacks shaping the meridional profile of warming (Ceppi et al., 2014; Voigt and Shaw, 2015, 2016; Ceppi and Hartmann, 2016; Ceppi and Shepherd, 2017; Lipat et al., 2018; Albern et al., 2019; Voigt et al., 2019). Climate models seem to underestimate the forced component of the year-to-year variability in the atmospheric circulation, particularly in the North Atlantic sector (Scaife and Smith, 2018), which suggests some relevant dynamical processes may not be well represented. Whether and how this may affect long-term projections is unknown. In conclusion, due to the influence from competing dynamical drivers and the absence of observational evidence, there is medium confidence in a projected poleward shift of the NH zonal- mean low-level westerlies in autumn and summer and low confidence in the other seasons. There is also overall low confidence in projected regional changes in the NH low-level westerlies, particularly for the North Atlantic basin in boreal winter."
AR6_WG1_4_36,4,54,"In the NH boreal winter, CMIP6 models show a northward shift of the ETC density in the North Pacific, a tripolar pattern in the North Atlantic, and a weakening of the Mediterranean storm track (Figure 4.27a). CMIP6 models show overall low agreement on changes in ETC density in the North Atlantic in boreal winter (Figure 4.27a). A poleward shift of the storm track is evident in the SH (Figure 4.27b), particularly in the Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors. CMIP6 models still feature long-standing biases in the representation of storm tracks; for example, the winter storm track into Europe is too zonal, though different measures of storm track activity INDICate some improvements compared to the previous generations of models (Harvey et al., 2020; Priestley et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_4_37,4,55,"The CMIP5 projections suggest that the response of blocking frequency to climate change might be quite complex (Dunn-Sigouin et al., 2013; Masato et al., 2013). An eastward shift of winter blocking activity in the NH is INDICated (Masato et al., 2013; Kitano and Yamada, 2016; Lee and Ahn, 2017; Matsueda and Endo, 2017) while during boreal summer, blocking frequency tends to decrease in mid-latitudes (Matsueda and Endo, 2017), with the exception of the eastern Europe–western Russia region (Masato et al., 2013). The projected decrease of blocking in boreal summer partially contrasts with the observed increase in Greenland blocking (Hanna et al., 2018; Davini and D’Andrea, 2020). However, as shown in Woollings et al. (2018), the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the suggested changes are sensitive to the blocking detection methods (Schwierz et al., 2004; Barriopedro et al., 2010; Davini et al., 2012). In the SH, blocking frequency is projected to decrease in the Pacific sector during austral spring and summer. However, seasonal and regional changes are not totally consistent across the models (Parsons et al., 2016), and, as assessed in Section 3.3.3.3, model biases might affect their response."

In boreal winter (DJF) under SSP5‑8.5, the central estimate is an increase in the NAM by almost 3 hPa in the long-term compared to 1995–2014. This can be compared to a multi-model mean interannual standard deviation in the winter NAM INDEX of 3.4 hPa during the period 1850–1900. We conclude with high confidence that in the mid- to long-term, the boreal wintertime surface NAM is more positive under SSP3‑7.0 and SSP5‑8.5, while under SSP1‑1.9 and SSP1‑2.6, the NAM does not show any robust change."
AR6_WG1_4_39,4,57,"4.5.3.1.2 The Southern Annular Mode The AR5 assessed it is likely that the evolution of the SAM over the 21st century will be primarily determined by the interplay between the effects of ozone recovery and changing GHG concentrations and influence the SAM in opposing ways. Owing to the relative effects of these two drivers, CMIP5 model SAM and Southern Hemisphere circulation projections differed markedly across forcing scenarios and across seasons (Barnes and Polvani, 2013; Barnes et al., 2014). CMIP5 models simulated a weak negative SAM trend in austral summer for RCP4.5 by the end of the century (F. Zheng et al., 2013), while for RCP8.5 they simulated a weak positive SAM trend in austral summer (F. Zheng et al., 2013). A substantial fraction of the spread in CMIP5 projections of the end of century SH summer jet shift under RCP8.5 may be attributable to differences in the simulated change in break-up of the stratospheric polar vortex, with models that produce a later break-up date showing a larger summertime poleward jet shift (Ceppi and Shepherd, 2019). For RCP2.6, the effect of ozone recovery on the SAM has been found to dominate over that of GHGs in austral summer (Eyring et al., 2013). In austral winter, the poleward shift of the SH circulation in CMIP5 models, and the associated increase in the SAM INDEX, tends to be larger, on average, in higher forcing scenarios though with substantial inter-model spread (Barnes et al., 2014). New research since the AR5 shows that the previous theory for the apparent relationship across models between the annual mean climatological SH jet position and the amplitude of forced SH jet shift (Kidston and Gerber, 2010) does not hold at seasonal time scales (Simpson and Polvani, 2016)."
AR6_WG1_4_40,4,57,"In most seasons, the SAM becomes more positive by the end of the century relative to 1995–2014 under SSP2‑4.5, SSP3‑7.0, and SSP5‑8.5 (Figure 4.30b). Conversely, under SSP1‑1.9 and SSP1‑2.6, in most seasons the SAM INDEX does not show a robust change compared to 1995–2014 except in austral summer when it becomes significantly more negative. The greatest change in the SAM occurs in austral winter, where CMIP6 models show an ensemble-mean increase in the SAM INDEX of almost 5 hPa in SSP5‑8.5. This can be compared to a multi-model mean interannual standard deviation in the austral winter SAM INDEX of 4.0 hPa during 1850–1900. In conclusion, there is high confidence that in high emissions scenarios (SSP3‑7.0 and SSP5‑8.5) the SAM becomes more positive in all seasons, while in the lowest scenario (SSP1‑1.9) there is a robust decrease in austral summer."

Model simulations INDICate stronger polar jets and weaker storm tracks and a poleward shift of the tropospheric mid-latitude jets in response to stratospheric sulphate injections in the tropics (Ferraro et al., 2015; Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018), as the meridional temperature gradient is increased in the lower stratosphere by the aerosol-induced heating. The aerosol-induced warming would also offset some of the GHG-induced stratospheric cooling. Compared to equatorial injection, off-equatorial injection is likely to result in reduced change in stratospheric heating, circulation, and QBO (Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018; Kravitz et al., 2019). Stratospheric ozone response to sulphate injection is uncertain depending on the amount, altitude, and location of injection (WMO, 2018). It is likely"
AR6_WG1_4_43,4,76,"that sulphate injection would cause a reduction in polar column ozone concentration and delay the recovery of Antarctic ozone hole (Pitari et al., 2014; Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018; Tilmes et al., 2018b), which would have implications for UV radiation and surface ozone (Pitari et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2017; Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018; Tilmes et al., 2018b). Injection of non-sulphate aerosols is likely to result in less stratospheric heating and ozone loss (Pope et al., 2012; Weisenstein et al., 2015; Keith et al., 2016). One side effect of SAI is increased sulphate deposition at surface. A recent modelling study INDICates that to maintain global temperature at 2020 levels under RCP 8.5, increased sulphate deposition from stratospheric sulphate injection could be globally balanced by the projected decrease in tropospheric anthropogenic SO emissions, but the spatial distribution of sulphate deposition would move from low to high latitudes (Visioni et al., 2020c)."
AR6_WG1_4_44,4,76,"Cirrus clouds trap more outgoing thermal radiation than they reflect incoming solar radiation and thus have an overall warming effect on the climate system (Mitchell and Finnegan, 2009). The aim of cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) is to reduce cirrus cloud optical depth by increasing the heterogeneous nucleation via seeding cirrus clouds with an optimal concentration of ice nucleating particles, which might cause larger ice crystals and rapid fallout, resulting in reduced lifetime and coverage of cirrus clouds (Muri et al., 2014; Gasparini et al., 2017; Lohmann and Gasparini, 2017; Gruber et al., 2019). CCT aims to achieve the opposite effect of contrails that increase cirrus cover and cause a small positive ERF (Section 7.3). A high-resolution modelling study of CCT over a limited area of the Arctic suggested that cirrus seeding causes a decrease in ice crystal number concentration and a reduction in mixed-phase cloud cover, both of which cause a cooling effect (Gruber et al., 2019). Under present-day climate, cirrus clouds exerts a net positive radiative forcing of about 5 W m –2 (Gasparini and Lohmann, 2016; Hong et al., 2016), INDICating a maximum cooling potential of the same magnitude if all cirrus cloud were removed from the climate system. However, modelling results show a much smaller cooling effect of CCT. For the optimal ice nuclei seeding concentration and globally non-uniform seeding strategy, a net negative cloud radiative forcing of about 1 to 2 W m –2 is achieved (Storelvmo and Herger, 2014; Gasparini et al., 2020). A few studies find that no seeding strategy could achieve a significant cooling effect, owing to complex microphysical mechanisms limiting robust climate responses to cirrus seeding (Penner et al., 2015; Gasparini and Lohmann, 2016). A higher than optimal concentration of ice nucleating particles could also result in over-seeding that increases rather than decreases cirrus optical thickness (Storelvmo et al., 2013; Gasparini and Lohmann, 2016). Thus, there is low confidence in the cooling effect of CCT, due to limited understanding of cirrus microphysics, its interaction with aerosols, and the complexity of seeding strategy. Relative to the high-GHG climate and for the same amount of global cooling, CCT is simulated to cause an increase in global precipitation compared to shortwave-based SRM options such as SAI and MCB (Duan et al., 2018; Muri et al., 2018) because of the opposing effects of CCT and increased CO on outgoing longwave radiation (Kristjánsson et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2016). Combining SAI and CCT has suggested that GHG-induced changes in global mean temperature and precipitation can be simultaneously offset (Cao et al., 2017), but there is low confidence in the applicability of this result to the real world owing to the large uncertainty in simulating aerosol forcing and the complex cirrus microphysical processes."
AR6_WG1_4_45,4,77,"A hypothetical, sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a world with high GHG concentrations has been simulated to cause climate rebound effects such as rapid increase in global temperature, precipitation, and sea level, and rapid reduction in sea ice area (Jones et al., 2013; McCusker et al., 2014; Crook et al., 2015; Muri et al., 2018). Model simulations also show reduced precipitation over land areas in the first few years following termination, INDICating general drying that would exacerbate the effects of rapid warming (McCusker et al., 2014). A sudden and sustained termination of SRM is also expected to weaken carbon sinks, accelerating atmospheric CO accumulation and warming (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019). A gradual phase-out of SRM combined with mitigation and CDR could reduce the large warming rates from sudden SRM termination (MacMartin et al., 2014; Keith and MacMartin, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016), though this would be limited by how rapidly emission reductions can be scaled up (Ekholm and Korhonen, 2016)."

Some models continue warming by up to 0.5°C after emissions cease at 2°C of warming (Frölicher et al., 2014; Frölicher and Paynter, 2015; Williams et al., 2017), while others simulate little to no additional warming (Nohara et al., 2015).

AR6_WG1_4_47,4,79,4.7.1.2 Change in Global Climate INDICES Beyond 2100
AR6_WG1_4_48,4,79,"This subsection assesses changes in global climate INDICES out to 2300 using extensions of the SSP scenarios (Meinshausen et al., 2020) and literature based on extensions to the RCP scenarios from CMIP5 (Meinshausen et al., 2011), which differ from the SSPs despite similar labelling of global radiative forcing levels (Section 4.6.2). Meinshausen et al. (2020) describe the extensions to the SSP scenarios, which differ slightly from the ScenarioMIP documentation (O’Neill et al., 2016). A simplified approach across scenarios reduces emissions such that after 2100, land-use CO emissions are reduced to zero by 2150; any net negative fossil CO emissions are reduced to zero by 2200, and positive fossil CO emissions are reduced to zero by 2250. Non-CO fossil fuel emissions are also reduced to zero by 2250 while land- use-related non-CO emissions are held constant at 2100 levels. The extensions are created up to the year 2500, but ESM simulations have only been requested, as part of the CMIP6 protocol, to run to 2300. As a result, unlike the RCP8.5 extension, SSP5‑8.5 sees a decline in CO concentration after 2250, but the radiative forcing level is similar, reaching approximately 12 W m –2 during most of the extension. Both SSP1‑2.6 and SSP5‑3.4-OS decrease radiative forcing after 2100. SSP5‑3.4-OS is designed to return to the same level of forcing as SSP1‑2.6 during the first half of the 22nd century. Because relatively few CMIP6 ESMs have submitted results beyond 2100, GSAT projections using the MAGICC7 emulator (see Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) are also shown here."
AR6_WG1_5_1,5,12,"Model-based estimates INDICate that wetland CH emissions were reduced by 24–40% during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when compared to pre-industrial, while CH emissions related to biomass burning (wildfires) decreased by 35–75% (Valdes et al., 2005; Hopcroft et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020). N O emissions decreased by about 30% during the LGM based on data-constrained model estimates (Schilt et al., 2014; H. Fischer et al., 2019) owing to a combination of a weaker hydrological cycle and a generally better ventilated intermediate depth ocean relative to present, reducing (de)nitrification processes (Galbraith et al., 2013; H. Fischer et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_5_2,5,13,"Ice core observations combined with model-based estimates thus reveal with high confidence that both terrestrial and marine CH and N O emissions were reduced under glacial climate conditions. Multiple lines of evidence INDICate with high confidence that enhanced storage of remineralized CO in the ocean interior, owing to a combination of synergistic mechanisms, was sufficient to balance the removal of carbon from the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere reservoirs combined during the last ice age."
AR6_WG1_5_3,5,14,"The gradual increase in atmospheric CO across the LDT was punctuated by three centennial 10–13 ppm increments, coeval with 100–200 ppb increases in CH (Marcott et al., 2014), reminiscent of similar oscillations reported for the last ice age associated with transient warming events (Dansgaard/Oeschger (DO) events; Ahn and Brook, 2014; Rhodes et al., 2017; Bauska et al., 2018) as well as previous deglacial transitions (Nehrbass-Ahles et al., 2020). The rate of change in atmospheric CO accumulation during these transient events exceeds the averaged deglacial growth rates by at least 50% (Table 2.1, Figure 5.4). The early deglacial release of remineralized carbon from the ocean abyss coincided with the resumption of Southern Ocean overturning circulation (Skinner et al., 2010; Schmitt et al., 2012; Ferrari et al., 2014; Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020a; Jaccard et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2018; Moy et al., 2019) and the concomitant reduction in the global efficiency of the marine BCP, associated, in part, with dwindling iron fertilization (Hain et al., 2010; Martínez-García et al., 2014; Jaccard et al., 2016) The two subsequent pulses, centred 14.8 and 12.9 ka, are associated with enhanced air–sea gas exchange in the Southern Ocean (T. Li et al., 2020), iron fertilization in the South Atlantic and North Pacific (Lambert et al., 2021) and rapid increase in soil respiration owing to the resumption of AMOC and associated southward migration of the ITCZ (Marcott et al., 2014; Bauska et al., 2018). Rapid warming of high northern latitudes contributed to thaw permafrost, possibly liberating labile organic carbon to the atmosphere (Köhler et al., 2014; Crichton et al., 2016; Winterfeld et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2019). Ocean surface pH reconstructions INDICate that the ocean was oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere during the early, mid-LDT (Martínez-Botí et al., 2015b; Shao et al., 2019; Shuttleworth et al., 2021), suggesting that ocean sources at that time may have been larger than terrestrial sources. Over the course of the LDT, the decrease in Northern Hemisphere permafrost carbon stocks has been more than compensated by an increase in the carbon stocks of mineral soils, peatland and vegetation (Lindgren et al., 2018; Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2019). The land biosphere was, on average, a net sink for atmospheric carbon and accumulated several hundred Gt of carbon over the LDT. Detailed investigations reveal that Antarctic air temperatures, and more generally Southern Hemisphere (30°S–60°S) proxy temperature reconstructions, led the rise in pCO at the onset of the LDT, 18 ka ago, by several hundred years (Shakun et al., 2012; Chowdhry Beeman et al., 2019). Atmospheric CO led reconstructed global average temperature by several centuries (Shakun et al., 2012), corroborating the importance of CO as an amplifier of orbitally driven warming. During the LDT, the phasing between Antarctic air temperature and atmospheric GHG concentration changes was nearly synchronous, yet variable, owing to the complex nature of the mechanisms modulating the global carbon cycle (Chowdhry Beeman et al., 2019). Mean ocean temperature reconstructions, based on noble gas extracted from Antarctic ice are closely correlated with Antarctic air temperature and pCO records, emphasizing the role the Southern Ocean is playing in modulating global climate variability (Bereiter et al., 2018; Baggenstos et al., 2019). Enhanced mid-ocean ridge magmatism and/or hydrothermal activity modulated by sea level rise has recently been hypothesized to have contributed to the deglacial CO rise (Crowley et al., 2015; Lund et al., 2016; Huybers and Langmuir, 2017; Stott et al., 2019b). While geological carbon release may have affected the ocean’s radiocarbon budget (Ronge et al., 2016; Rafter et al., 2019; Stott et al., 2019a), model results suggest that the potential contribution of geological carbon sources to the atmosphere remained small (Roth and Joos, 2012; Hasenclever et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_5_4,5,14,"Independent paleoclimatic evidence suggests with high confidence that marine and terrestrial CH and N O emissions are highly sensitive to climate on (sub)centennial time scales. Limited, yet internally consistent ice core measurements INDICate with medium confidence that pulsed geologic CH release from continental margins associated with warming remained negligible across the LDT. Multiple lines of evidence suggest with high confidence that CO was released from the ocean interior on centennial time scales during the LDT in response to, or associated with warming, contributing to the transition out of the last glacial stage to the current interglacial period."
AR6_WG1_5_5,5,14,"Multiple lines of evidence inferred from marine sediment proxies INDICate with low to medium confidence that the millennial rates of CO concentration change in the atmosphere during the last 56 Myr were at least four to five times lower than during the last century (Figure 5.3).

AR6_WG1_5_6,5,19,"2014). The sink rate has declined over the past six decades, which INDICates that the combined ocean and land sinks are not growing as fast as the growth in atmospheric CO (Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). Possible explanations for the sink rate decline are that the land and/or ocean CO sinks are no longer responding linearly with CO concentrations or that anthropogenic emissions are slower than exponential (Figure 5.7 and Sections 5.2.1.3 and 5.2.1.4; Gloor et al., 2010; Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). In addition, both diagnostics are influenced by major climate modes (e.g., ENSO) and volcanic eruptions that contribute to high interannual variability (Gloor et al., 2010; Frölicher et al., 2013; Raupach et al., 2014), suggesting high sensitivity to future climate change. Uncertain land-use change fluxes (Section 5.2.1.2) influence the robustness of the trends. Based on the airborne fraction (AF), it is concluded with medium confidence that both ocean and land CO sinks have grown consistent with the rising of anthropogenic emissions. Further research is needed to understand the drivers of changes in the CO sink rate."
AR6_WG1_5_7,5,22,"Carbon uptake by vegetation photosynthesis exerts a first-order control over the net land CO sink. Several lines of evidence show enhanced vegetation photosynthesis over the past decades (medium to high confidence) (Figure 5.10), including increasing satellite-derived vegetation greenness (e.g., see Chapter 2; Mao et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2019) and satellite-derived photosynthesis INDICATORs (e.g., Badgley et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), change in atmospheric concentration of carbonyl sulphide (Campbell et al., 2017), enhanced seasonal CO amplitude (Graven et al., 2013; Forkel et al., 2016), observation-driven inference of increasing photosynthesis CO uptake based mostly on enhanced water use efficiency (Cheng et al., 2017), and DGVM simulated increase of photosynthesis CO uptake (Anav et al., 2015). Substantial progress has been made since AR5 on attributing change of the global net land CO sink. Increasing global net land CO sink since the 1980s is mainly driven by the fertilization effect from rising atmospheric CO concentrations (Schimel et al., 2015; Sitch et al., 2015; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2019; O’Sullivan et al., 2019; Tagesson et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2021) (medium confidence). Increasing nitrogen deposition (de Vries et al., 2009; Devaraju et al., 2016; Huntzinger et al., 2017) or the synergy between increasing nitrogen deposition and atmospheric CO concentration (O’Sullivan et al., 2019) could have also contributed to the increasing global net land CO sink. The effects of climate change alone on the global net land CO sink is so divergent that even the signs (directions) of the effects are not the same across DGVMs (e.g., Huntzinger et al., 2017)."

AR6_WG1_5_11,5,32,"Freshwater wetlands are the single largest global natural source of CH in the atmosphere, accounting for about 26% of the total CH source (robust evidence, medium agreement). Progress has been made since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) in better constraining freshwater lake and river emissions and reducing double counting with wetland emissions. Bottom-up and top-down estimates for 2008–2017 are 149 and 180 Tg yr –1 , respectively, with a top- down uncertainty range of 159–199 Tg yr –1 (Table 5.2). The large uncertainties stem from challenges in mapping wetland area and temporal dynamics to landscape estimates, and in scaling methane production, transport and consumption processes that are measured with small chambers or flux towers (Pham-Duc et al., 2017). Both the top-down and bottom-up estimates presented in Table 5.2 INDICate little increase in wetland CH emissions during the last three decades, with the new estimates being slightly smaller than in AR5 due to updated wetland maps and ecosystem model simulations (Melton et al., 2013; Poulter et al., 2017). Wetland emissions show strong interannual variability due to the changes in inundated land area, air temperature and microbial activity (Bridgham et al., 2013). Present terrestrial ecosystem model simulated CH emissions variability does not produce strong correlation with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 2), although observation evidence is emerging for lower CH emissions during El Niños and greater emissions during La Niña (Pandey et al., 2017). Trees in upland and wetland forests contribute to CH emissions by abiotic production in the canopy, by the methanogenesis taking place in the stem, and by conducting CH from soil into the atmosphere (Covey and Megonigal, 2019). There is emerging evidence of the important role of trees in transporting and conducting CH from soils into the atmosphere, especially in tropics (Pangala et al., 2017), whereas direct production of CH by vegetation only has a minor contribution (limited evidence, high agreement) (Bruhn et al., 2012; Covey and Megonigal, 2019). The contribution of trees in transporting CH may further widen the gap between the bottom-up and top-down estimates in the global budget, particularly needing a re-assessment of emissions in the tropics and in forested wetlands of temperate and boreal regions (Pangala et al., 2017; Jeffrey et al., 2019; Welch et al., 2019; Sjögersten et al., 2020)."

Current estimates are based on atmospheric measurements with high accuracy and density (Francey et al., 2003; Elkins et al., 2018; Prinn et al., 2018), and pre-industrial estimates are based on multiple ice-core records (Section 2.2.3.2.3). The average annual tropospheric growth rate was 0.85 ± 0.03 ppb yr –1 during the period 1995 to 2019 (Figure 5.15a). The atmospheric growth rate increased by about 20% between the decade 2000–2009 and the most recent decade of 2010–2019 (0.95 ± 0.04 ppb yr –1 ) (robust evidence, high agreement). The growth rate in 2010–2019 was also higher than during 1970–2000 (0.6– 0.8 ppb yr –1 ; Ishijima et al., 2007) and the 30-year period prior to 2011 (0.73 ± 0.03 ppb yr –1 ), as reported by AR5. New evidence since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3) confirms that, in the tropics and subtropics, large interannual variations in the atmospheric growth rate are negatively correlated with the multivariate ENSO INDEX (MEI) and associated anomalies in land and ocean fluxes (Ji et al., 2019; Thompson et al., 2019; S.

AR6_WG1_5_13,5,36,"As assessed by SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a), combined firn, ice, air and atmospheric measurements show that the 15 N/ 14 N isotope ratio (robust evidence, high agreement) and the predominant position of the 15 N atom in atmospheric N O (limited evidence, low agreement) in N O has changed since 1940 (Figure 5.15b, c) whereas they were relatively constant in the pre-industrial period (Ishijima et al., 2007; Park et al., 2012; Prokopiou et al., 2017, 2018). The SRCCL concluded that this change INDICates a shift in the nitrogen-substrate available for denitrification, and the relative contribution of nitrification to the global N O source (robust evidence, high agreement), which are associated with increased fertilizer use in agriculture (Park et al., 2012; Snider et al., 2015; Prokopiou et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_5_14,5,37,"The AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3) and SRCCL (Section 2.3.3) concluded that agriculture is the largest anthropogenic source of N O emissions. Since SRCCL (2.3.3), a new synthesis of inventory- based and modelling studies shows that the widespread use of synthetic fertilizers and manure on cropland and pasture, manure management and aquaculture resulted in 3.8 (2.5–5.8) TgN yr –1 (average 2007–2016) (robust evidence, high agreement) (Table 5.3; Winiwarter et al., 2018; FAO, 2019; Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020). Observations from field-measurements (Song et al., 2018), inventories (Wang et al., 2020) and atmospheric inversions (Thompson et al., 2019) further corroborate the assessment of SRCCL that there is a non-linear relationship between N O emissions and nitrogen input, implying an increasing fraction of fertilizer lost as N O with larger fertilizer excess (medium evidence, high agreement). Several studies using complementary methods INDICate that agricultural N O emissions have increased by more than 45% since the 1980s (high confidence) (Figure 5.16 and Table 5.3; Davidson, 2009; Winiwarter et al., 2018; Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020), mainly due to the increased use of nitrogen fertilizer and manure. N O emissions from aquaculture are among the fastest rising contributors of N O emissions, but their overall magnitude is still small in the overall N O budget (Tian et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_5_15,5,40,"Supported by multiple studies and extensive observational evidence (Sections 5.2.3.2–5.2.3.4 and Figure 5.17), anthropogenic emissions contributed about 40% (7.3; uncertainty range: 4.2 to 11.4 TgN yr –1 ) to the total N O source in 2007–2016 (high confidence). This estimate is larger than in AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3) due to a larger estimated effect of nitrogen deposition on soil N O emissions and the explicit consideration of the role of anthropogenic nitrogen in determining inland water and estuary emissions. Based on bottom-up estimates, anthropogenic emissions from agricultural nitrogen use, industry and other indirect effects have increased by 1.7 (1.0 to 2.7) TgN yr –1 between the decades 1980– 1989 and 2007–2016, and are the primary cause of the increase in the total N O source (high confidence). Atmospheric inversions INDICate that changes in surface emissions, rather than in the atmospheric transport or sink of N O, are the cause for the increased atmospheric growth rate of N O (robust evidence, high agreement) (Thompson et al., 2019). However, the increase of 1.6 (1.4 to 1.7) TgN yr –1 in global emissions between 2000–2005 and 2010–2015 based on atmospheric inversions is somewhat larger than bottom-up estimates over the same period, primarily because of differences in the estimates of land-based emissions."
AR6_WG1_5_16,5,42,"A limited number of independent proxy records INDICate that the PETM was associated with a surface ocean pH decline ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 units (Penman et al., 2014; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al., 2018). It was also accompanied by a rapid (<10 ka) shallowing of the carbonate saturation horizon, resulting in the widespread dissolution of sedimentary carbonate, followed by a gradual (100 kyr) recovery (Zachos et al., 2005; Bralower et al., 2018). The remarkable similarity among sedimentary records spanning a wide range of ecosystems suggests with medium confidence that the perturbation in the ocean carbonate saturation was global (Babila et al., 2018) and directly resulted from elevated atmospheric CO levels. The degree of acidification is similar to the 0.4 pH unit decrease projected for the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (Gattuso et al., 2015) and is estimated to have occurred at a rate about one order of magnitude slower than the current rate of ocean acidification (Zeebe et al., 2016).

Intermediate depths lost oxygen as a result of sluggish ventilation and increasing temperatures (decreasing saturation). As the world emerged from the last Glacial period, OMZs underwent a large volumetric increase at the beginning of the Bølling-Allerød (B/A), a northern-hemisphere wide warming event, 14.7 ka (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Praetorius et al., 2015) with deleterious consequences for benthic ecosystems (e.g., Moffitt et al., 2015). These observations INDICate with high confidence that the rate of warming, affecting the solubility of oxygen and upper water column stratification, coupled with changes in subsurface ocean ventilation, impose a direct control on the degree of ocean deoxygenation, implying a high sensitivity of ocean oxygen loss to warming. The expansion of OMZs contributed to a widespread increase in water column (de)nitrification (Galbraith and Kienast, 2013), which contributed substantially to enhanced marine N O"

AR6_WG1_5_19,5,44,"The SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3) INDICated that it is virtually certain that the ocean has undergone acidification globally in response to ocean CO uptake, and concluded that pH in open ocean surface water has changed by a virtually certain range of –0.017 to –0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1980s. Since SROCC, evidence of the progress of acidification across all regions of the oceans has been further strengthened by continued observations of seawater carbonate chemistry at ocean time series stations, and compiled shipboard studies providing temporally resolved and methodologically consistent datasets (Jiang et al., 2019) (Figure 5.20; Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3; Section 2.3.3.5)."

AR6_WG1_5_21,5,57,"Since AR5 (Section 6.3.2.5.6), progress has been made in understanding the biological drivers of ocean carbon uptake in both coupled climate models and observations (SROCC, Section 5.2.2.6). Here we focus on potential feedbacks between biological processes and climate. In CMIP5 models, the direction of modelled PP in response to increased atmospheric CO concentration and climate warming was unclear (Taucher and Oschlies, 2011; Laufkötter et al., 2015). This remains the case in the CMIP6 models; inter-model uncertainty has increased in CMIP6 models, compared to CMIP5. The projected global multi-model mean change in PP in 13 models run under the SSP5−8.5 scenario is −3 ± 9% (2080–2099 mean values relative to 1870–1899 ± the inter-model standard deviation; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Under the low-emissions, high-mitigation scenario SSP1−2.6, the global change in PP is −0.56 ± 4%. Observations in the contemporary period provide little direct constraint on the modelled responses of PP to climate change, partly due to insufficiently long records (Henson et al., 2016). However, there is some INDICation of an emergent constraint on changes in tropical PP based on interannual variability derived from remote sensing (Section 5.4.6; Kwiatkowski et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_5_22,5,64,"In these idealized 1% per year CO runs, the CMIP6 models show reasonable agreement on the patterns of carbon uptake and also on the separate impacts of CO increase and climate change (Figure 5.27). For the ensemble mean, increasing atmospheric CO increases carbon uptake by the oceans, especially in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean, and on the land, especially in tropical and boreal forests (β, Figure 5.27a). Climate change further enhances land carbon storage in the boreal zone, but has a compensating negative impact on the carbon sink in tropical and subtropical lands, and in the North Atlantic Ocean (γ, Figure 5.27b). Overall, the ensemble mean of the CMIP6 ESMs model INDICates increasing carbon storage with CO in almost all locations (Figure 5.27c). 5.4.6 Emergent Constraints to Reduce Uncertainties in Projections Emergent constraints are based on relationships between observable aspects of the current or past climate (such as trends or variability), and uncertain aspects of future climate change (such as the strength of particular feedbacks). These relationships are evident across an ensemble of models. When combined with an observational estimate of the trend or variability in the real climate, such emergent relationships can yield ‘emergent constraints’ on future climate change (Hall et al., 2019). At the time of AR5 (WGI, Section 9.8.3), there had been relatively few applications of the technique to constrain carbon cycle sensitivities, but there have been many studies published since (e.g., the summary in Cox, 2019). Figure 5.28 shows some key published emergent constraints on the carbon cycle in ESMs."
AR6_WG1_5_23,5,70,"Seasonal predictability of air-land CO flux up to 6–8 months is driven by the state of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Zeng et al., 2008; Betts et al., 2018). Fewer land carbon initialized predictions are available from decadal prediction systems, yet they tend to outperform the uninitialized simulations in capturing the major year- to-year variations, as INDICated by higher correlations with the global carbon budget estimates. There is growing evidence that the potential predictive skill of air-land CO flux is maintained out to a lead-time of two years (Lovenduski et al., 2019b); this predictability horizon is also supported by perfect model studies (Séférian et al., 2018a; Spring and Ilyina, 2020). The origins of this interannual predictability are not yet fully understood. However, they seem to be associated with the oscillatory behaviour of ENSO (Séférian et al., 2014) and the drivers of terrestrial carbon flux predictability, such as ecosystem respiration and gross primary production (Lovenduski et al., 2019a). Initialized simulations suggest that observed variability in the land carbon sink is improved through initialization of prediction systems with the observed state of the physical climate."

AR6_WG1_5_25,5,74,"The AR5 INDICated that the concept of a constant ratio of cumulative emissions of CO to temperature was applicable to scenarios with increasing cumulative CO emissions up to 2000 PgC (M. Collins et al., 2013). Recent analyses added confidence to this insight (Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Steinacher and Joos, 2016) and showed some evidence of a potentially larger window of constant TCRE (Leduc et al., 2015; Tokarska et al., 2016). Using an analytical approach, MacDougall and Friedlingstein (2015) quantified a window of constant TCRE – defined as the range in cumulative emissions over which the TCRE remains within 95% of its maximum value – as between 360 to 1560 PgC. However, models with a more sophisticated ocean representation suggest that TCRE could also remain constant for considerably larger quantities of cumulative emissions, up to at least 3000 PgC (Leduc et al., 2015; Tokarska et al., 2016). Beyond this upper limit, studies are inconclusive, with some suggesting that TCRE will decrease (Leduc et al., 2015) and others INDICating that the linearity would hold up to as much as 5000 PgC (Tokarska et al., 2016). As cumulative emissions increase, weakening land and ocean carbon sinks increase the airborne fraction of CO emissions (see Figure 5.25), but each unit increase in atmospheric CO has a smaller effect on global temperature owing to the logarithmic relationship between CO and its radiative forcing (Matthews et al., 2009; Etminan et al., 2016). At high values of cumulative emissions, some models simulate less warming per unit CO emitted, suggesting that the saturation of CO radiative forcing becomes more important than the effect of weakened carbon sinks (Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Leduc et al., 2015). The behaviour of carbon sinks at high emissions levels remains uncertain, as models used to assess the limits of the TCRE show a large spread in net land carbon balance (Section 5.4.5), and most estimates did not include the effect of permafrost carbon feedbacks (Sections 5.5.1.2.3 and 5.4). The latter would tend to further increase the airborne fraction at high cumulative emissions levels, and could therefore extend the window of linearity to higher total amounts of emissions (MacDougall et al., 2015). Leduc et al. (2016) suggested further that a declining strength of snow and sea ice feedbacks in a warmer world would also contribute to a smaller TCRE at high carbonate combined with shared physical ocean processes CO and heat in the ocean, which is the basis for the carbon– carbon-heat nexus help understand the quasi-linear and path emissions commitment (ZEC; Section 5.5) (medium confidence). confidence that carbon chemistry and warming will strengthen the and medium confidence that ocean circulation may partially carbon storage. Increasing ocean warming and stratification which could reduce the path independence of TCRE, though this associated with increasing winds (low confidence). amounts of cumulative emissions. However, Tokarska et al. (2016) suggested that a large decrease in TCRE for high cumulative emissions is only associated with some EMICs; in the four ESMs analysed in their study, the TCRE remained approximately constant up to 5000 PgC, owing to stronger declines in the efficiency of ocean heat uptake in ESMs compared to EMICs."

AR6_WG1_5_27,5,96,"Modelling studies consistently show that, relative to a high-CO world without SRM, SRM-induced cooling (Section 4.6.3.3) would reduce plant and soil respiration, and also reduce the negative effects of warming on ocean carbon uptake (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Jiang et al., 2018; Muri et al., 2018; Sonntag et al., 2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020). A multi-model study (Plazzotta et al., 2019) INDICates that, relative to a high-CO concentration world without SRM, stratospheric sulphur dioxide (SO ) injection increases the allowable CO emissions by enhancing CO uptake by both land and ocean (Figure 5.37). As a result of enhanced global carbon uptake, SRM would reduce the burden of atmospheric CO (high confidence). However, the amount of SRM-induced reduction in atmospheric CO depends on the future emissions scenario and modelled oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks, which differ widely between models (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Muri et al., 2018). Models that include the terrestrial nitrogen cycle usually report a much smaller reduction of atmospheric CO in response to SRM than models without the nitrogen cycle, mainly because nitrogen limitation leads to a weaker terrestrial carbon sink (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; C.-E.

Larger discrepancies exist at the sectoral and regional levels, notably for coal mining (Peng et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2019) and the oil and gas sector due to the growth of unconventional production and higher loss estimates (Section 5.2.2; Franco et al., 2016; Alvarez et al., 2018; Dalsøren et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_6_2,6,15,"At the plant level, BVOC emissions rates and composition depend strongly on plant species with plants tending to emit either isoprene or monoterpenes but not both. Photosynthetic activity is a main driver of isoprene and monoterpene production. Therefore, radiation and temperature, along with leaf-water status, phenological state and atmospheric CO mixing ratio, affect emissions directly (on the leaf scale) and indirectly (via plant productivity; Guenther et al., 2012; Loreto et al., 2014; Niinemets et al., 2014). CO directly influences the isoprene-synthesis process, with inhibition under increasing atmospheric CO (Rosenstiel et al., 2003; Possell et al., 2005; Wilkinson et al., 2009). Direct CO inhibition has been observed for some monoterpene compounds (Loreto et al., 2001; Llorens et al., 2009). Severe/long-term water stress may reduce emissions whilst mild/short-term water stress may temporarily amplify or maintain BVOC emissions to protect plants against ongoing stress (Peñuelas and Staudt, 2010; Potosnak et al., 2014; Genard-Zielinski et al., 2018). Furthermore, observations in the Amazon INDICate that the chemical composition of monoterpene emissions could also change under elevated temperature conditions (Jardine et al., 2016). In addition, all these processes are investigated over short time scales but the long- term response of BVOC emissions depends on how the vegetation"

AR6_WG1_6_4,6,16,"For the last two decades, model-based emissions estimates are constrained by remote-sensing capacity to detect active fires and area burned. In AR5, biomass burning emissions were derived from a satellite product (Lamarque et al., 2010). Since then, improvements in detection of small fires has enhanced the agreement with higher- resolution and ground-based data on burned area in several regions (Randerson et al., 2012; Mangeon et al., 2015), especially for areas subjected to agricultural waste burning (Chuvieco et al., 2016, 2019). The updated emissions factors and the contribution of forest versus savanna fires lead to significantly higher global emissions of NO and lower emissions of OC and CO in CMIP6, compared with CMIP5. A recent compilation and assessment of emissions factors (Andreae, 2019) INDICates that the emissions factors from Akagi et al. (2011), primarily used to produce the CMIP6 datasets, differ by ±50% for CO, OC, BC and NO , depending on the biome, and would imply, for example, up to 10–30% higher OC and BC emissions from tropical forest fires."

AR6_WG1_6_6,6,20,"About 10% of the total atmospheric ozone column resides in the troposphere. The ozone forcing on climate strongly depends on its vertical and latitudinal distribution in the troposphere. The lifetime of ozone in the troposphere ranges from a few hours in polluted urban regions to up to few months in the upper troposphere. Observed tropospheric ozone concentrations range from less than 10 ppb over the tropical Pacific Ocean to as much as 100 ppb in the upper troposphere and more than 100 ppb downwind of major ozone precursor emissions regions. An ensemble of five CMIP6 models including whole atmospheric chemistry and interactive ozone has been shown to simulate consistently the present-day ozone distribution (north to south and latitudinal gradients) and its seasonal variability when compared with observations from sondes, background surface stations and satellite products (Griffiths et al., 2021). The biases, whose magnitude is similar to AR5, are lower than 15% against climatological seasonal cycles from ozonesondes with an overestimate in the Northern Hemisphere and an underestimate in the Southern Hemisphere (Griffiths et al., 2021). The CMIP6 multi- model ensemble estimate of the global mean lifetime of ozone for present-day conditions is 25.5 ± 2.2 days (Griffiths et al., 2021), which is within the range of previous multi-model estimates (Stevenson et al., 2006; Young et al., 2013), INDICating a high level of confidence."
AR6_WG1_6_7,6,22,"Since the mid-20th century, the CMIP6 model ensemble shows a higher global trend (Figure 6.4). Since the mid-1990s, the trends are better documented by observations (Section 2.2.5.3) and INDICate spatial heterogeneity. In particular, in situ observations at remote surface sites and in the lower free troposphere INDICate positive trends that are far more common than negative trends, especially in the northern tropics and across Southern and Eastern Asia (Figure 6.5). The CMIP6 ensemble and observations largely agree on the magnitude of the global positive trend since 1997 (0.82 ± 0.13 Tg yr –1 in the model ensemble; 0.70 ± 0.15 Tg yr –1 in the ozonesonde dataset; 0.83 ± 0.85 Tg yr –1 in the satellite ensemble) and qualitatively reproduce positive trends in the Southern Hemisphere (Griffiths et al., 2021).

AR6_WG1_6_8,6,23,"The AR5 reported NO decreases by 30–50% in Europe and North America, and increases by more than a factor of two in Asia, over the 1996–2011 period based on satellite observations (Hartmann et al., 2013). Extension of this analysis covering the time period up to 2015 reveals that NO has continued to decline over the USA, Western Europe and Japan (Schneider et al., 2015; Duncan et al., 2016; Krotkov et al., 2016) because of effective fossil fuel NO emissions controls (Section 6.2), although this rate of decline has slowed down post-2011 (Jiang et al., 2018). Satellite observations also reveal a 32% decline in NO column over China after peaking in 2011 (Figure 6.6b), consistent with declining NO emissions (Section 6.2) due to the implementation of emissions-control strategies (de Foy et al., 2016; Irie et al., 2016; F. Liu et al., 2016). Over Southern Asia, tropospheric NO levels have grown rapidly with increases of 50% during 2005–2015, largely driven by hotspot areas in India experiencing rapid expansion of the power sector (Duncan et al., 2016; Krotkov et al., 2016). Further analysis INDICates that many parts of India have also undergone a reversal in NO trends since 2011 that has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a slowdown in economic growth, implementation of cleaner technologies, non-linear NO chemistry, and meteorological variability (Georgoulias et al., 2019).

There is high confidence that NO has declined over the USA and Western Europe since the mid-1990s and increased over China until 2011. NO trends have reversed (declining) over China beginning in 2012 and NO has increased over Southern Asia by 50% since 2005 (medium confidence)."
AR6_WG1_6_10,6,25,"The AR5 reported a global CO decline of about 1% yr –1 based on satellite data from 2002–2010, but biases in instruments rendered low confidence in this trend. The AR5 also INDICated a small CO decrease from in situ networks but did not provide quantitative estimates. New analysis of CO trends performed since AR5 and based on different observational platforms and assimilation products show a decline globally and over most regions during the last one to two decades with varying amplitudes partly depending on the period of analysis (Table 6.4). Inversion-based analysis attributes the global CO decline during the past two decades to decreases in anthropogenic and biomass-burning CO emissions despite probable increase in atmospheric CO chemical production (Gaubert et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2019). Furthermore, Buchholz et al. (2021) report a slowdown in global CO decline in 2010–2018 compared to 2002–2010, although the magnitude and sign of this change in the trend varies regionally. Global models prescribed with emissions inventories developed prior to the CMIP6 inventory capture the declining observed CO trends over North America and Europe but not over Eastern Asia (Strode et al., 2016). CMIP6 models driven by CMIP6 emissions simulate a negative trend in global CO burden over the 1990–2020 period (Griffiths et al., 2021), however the simulated trends have not yet been evaluated against observations."

AR6_WG1_6_12,6,26,"Considerable expansion of satellite (Clarisse et al., 2009; Shephard and Cady-Pereira, 2015; Warner et al., 2016) and ground-based observations (Miller et al., 2014; Y. Li et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2018) has improved our understanding of the spatial distribution and seasonal to interannual variability of ammonia, and advanced its representations in models (e.g., Zhu et al., 2015). Regionally, peak NH concentrations are observed over large agricultural (e.g., northern India, the USA Midwest and Central Valley) and biomass-burning regions, in good qualitative agreement with emissions inventories (Van Damme et al., 2015, 2018). However, several large agricultural and industrial hotspots have been found to be missing or greatly underestimated in emissions inventories (Van Damme et al., 2018). NH exhibits a strong vertical gradient, with a maximum in the boundary layer (Schiferl et al., 2016), and can be transported into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), particularly in the Asian Monsoon region, as INDICated by observations (Froyd et al., 2009; Höpfner et al., 2016, 2019) and theoretical considerations (Ge et al., 2018). There is a large range in the present-day NH burden (from 0.04–0.7 TgN) simulated by CCMs, highlighting deficiencies in the process-level representation of NH in current global models (Bian et al., 2017). The underestimate of surface NH concentrations (Bian et al., 2017) further highlights such deficiencies and the limitations in comparing site-specific observations with relatively coarse-resolution models. Observations show that NH concentration has been increasing in recent decades in the USA (Butler et al., 2016; Warner et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018), Western Europe (van Zanten et al., 2017; Warner et al., 2017; Wichink Kruit et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018), and China (Warner et al., 2017; M. Liu et al., 2018). This trend has been attributed to a combination of increasing ammonia emissions (Sutton et al., 2013; Fowler et al., 2015) and decreases in the chemical reaction of NH with nitric and sulphuric acids associated with reductions in SO and NO emissions whose rate depends on the region (Warner et al., 2017; Yao and Zhang, 2019). Over longer time scales, CCMs simulate an increase of the NH burden by a factor of two to seven since pre- industrial conditions (Xu and Penner, 2012; Hauglustaine et al., 2014). In summary, progress has been made in the understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of ammonia, though representation of NH remains rather unsatisfactory due to process-level uncertainties. Evidence from observations and models suggests that ammonia concentrations have been increasing over recent decades due to emissions and chemistry. There is high confidence that the global NH burden has increased considerably from the pre-industrial period to the present day, although the magnitude of the increase remains uncertain. 6.3.3.5 Sulphur Dioxide (SO )"

From about 2000, global mean AOD stabilized in the models, driven by soaring emissions in Southern Asia and declining emissions in Eastern Asia (Section 6.2.1). Trends after around 2010 are difficult to assess from CMIP6 models because the historical simulations end at 2014. Nevertheless, the strong decline in anthropogenic SO emissions over Eastern Asia since 2011 is underestimated in the CMIP6 emissions database (Hoesly et al., 2018), INDICating that the observed AOD change over Eastern Asia may not be captured accurately by CMIP6 models (Wang et al., 2021). While all CMIP6 models simulate the increase of AOD between 1850 and 2014 there is strong inter-model diversity in the simulated AOD change since 1850 ranging from 0.01 (15%) to 0.08 (53%) in 2014. Some models therefore lie outside the 68% confidence interval of 0.02 (15%) to 0.04 (or 30%) for global AOD change in 2005–2015 compared to 1850, estimated by Bellouin et al. (2020) based on observational and model (excluding CMIP6) lines of evidence.

In India, on the other hand, satellite observations INDICate a rapid increase in the SO levels (Krotkov et al., 2016), and long-term measurements of sulphate in precipitation in India further provide evidence of an increasing trend from 1980–2010 (Bhaskar and Rao, 2017; Aas et al., 2019).

However, there was large diversity in both the sign and magnitude of past OH changes across the individual models attributed to the disparate implementation of chemical and physical processes (Nicely et al., 2017; Wild et al., 2020).

However, there is no observational evidence of changes in global OH since 1850 up to the early 1980s to evaluate the ESMs."
AR6_WG1_6_19,6,40,"(b) Zonal mean change in surface air temperature due to aerosols The Arctic region is warming considerably faster than the rest of the globe (Atlas 11.2.2) and, generally, studies INDICate that this amplification of the temperature response toward the Arctic has an important contribution from local and remote aerosol forcing (Stjern et al., 2017; Westervelt et al., 2018). Several studies INDICate that changes in long-range transport of sulphate and BC from northern mid-latitudes can potentially explain a significant fraction of Arctic warming since the 1980s (e.g., Navarro et al., 2016; Breider et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2020). Modelling studies show that changes in mid-latitude aerosols have influenced Arctic climate by changing the radiative balance through aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions, and enhancing poleward heat transport (Navarro et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2020). Idealized aerosol-perturbation studies have shed further light on the sensitivity of Arctic temperature response to individual aerosol species. Studies show relatively large responses in the Arctic to BC perturbations and reveal the importance of remote BC forcing by rapid adjustments (Sand et al., 2013b; Stjern et al., 2017; L. Liu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019b). Perturbations in SO emissions over major emitting regions in the Northern Hemisphere have been shown to produce the largest Arctic temperature responses (Kasoar et al., 2018; Lewinschal et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_6_20,6,42,"Climate–sea-spray feedback: Sea-spray emissions from ocean surfaces influence climate directly or indirectly through the formation of CCN as discused in Section 6.2.1.2. They are sensitive to SST and sea ice extent, as well as to wind speed, and are therefore expected to feedback on climate (Struthers et al., 2013). However, there are large uncertainties in the strength of climate feedback from sea- spray aerosols because of the diversity in the model representation of emissions (many represent sea-salt emissions only) and their functional dependence on environmental factors noted above, in situ atmospheric chemical and physical processes affecting the sea-spray lifetime, and aerosol–cloud interactions (Struthers et al., 2013; Soares et al., 2016; Nazarenko et al., 2017). Additional work is needed to identify how sea‑spray and POA emissions respond to shifts in ocean biology and chemistry in response to warming, ocean acidification and changes in circulation patterns (Cochran et al., 2017), and affect CCN and INP formation (DeMott et al., 2016). AerChemMIP models, representing only the sea-salt emissions, agree that the sea‑salt‑climate feedback is negative, however there is a large range in the feedback parameter INDICating large uncertainties (Table 6.8). Climate–DMS feedback: Dimethyl sulphide (DMS) is produced by marine phytoplankton and is emitted to the atmosphere where it can lead to the subsequent formation of sulphate aerosol and CCN (Section 6.2.2.5). Changes in DMS emissions from ocean could feedback on climate through their response to changes in temperature, solar radiation, ocean mixed-layer depth, sea ice extent, wind speed, nutrient recycling or shifts in marine ecosystems due to ocean acidification and climate change, or atmospheric processing of DMS into CCN (Heinze et al., 2019).

The net-NO term is generally agreed to be a positive RF in the present day, although attribution in a non-linear chemical system is problematic (Grewe et al., 2019), but Skowron et al. (2021) point out that the sign of net NO term is dependent on background conditions and could be negative under certain future scenarios."
AR6_WG1_6_22,6,56,"Air-quality policies emerged several decades ago focusing on emissions mitigation, first driven by local- then by regional-scale air-quality and ecosystem-damage concerns, that is, health impacts, acidification and eutrophication. They have made it possible to reduce or limit pollution exposure in many megacities or highly populated regions, for example, in Los Angeles, Mexico City and Houston in North America (Parrish et al., 2011), Santiago in Chile (Gallardo et al., 2018), São Paulo in Brazil (Andrade et al., 2017), Europe (Reis et al., 2012; Crippa et al., 2016; Serrano et al., 2019), and over Eastern Asia during the last decade (Silver et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018b). However, very few studies have quantified the impact of these policies on climate. The AR5 concluded that air-quality control will have consequences on climate including strong regional variability, however, no estimates of impacts of specific air-quality policy were available. Since AR5, few studies have provided estimates of climate-relevant INDICATORs affected by significant air pollutant burden changes due to air-quality policy in selected regions. Turnock et al. (2016) estimated that the strong decrease in NO , SO and PM emissions in Europe, induced by air-quality policies resulting in implementation of abatement measures since the 1970s, have caused a surface warming of +0.45°C ± 0.11°C and increase of precipitation +13 ± 0.8 mm yr –1 over Europe, compared to the scenario without such policies. While the temperature increase is likely overestimated since the impact of the increase in ammonium nitrate was not considered in this study, the simulated European all-sky TOA radiative effect of the European air pollutant mitigation over the period 1970–2009 is 2.5 times the change in global mean CO radiative forcing over the same period (Myhre et al., 2013). Other studies found that the recent measures to reduce pollution over China have induced a decrease of aerosols and increase of ozone over east China (K. Li et al., 2019, 2020), resulting in an overall warming effect mainly due to the dominant effect of sulphate reductions in the period 2012–2017 (Dang and Liao, 2019)."

Additionally, assumptions about urbanization (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017) will affect the spatial distribution of emissions and consequently air quality.

The effect and extent of urbanization on air pollution and other emissions species are captured within Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) at varying levels of complexity. In most cases, models use a combination of proxies and assumptions of end-use efficiency and technological improvement assumptions to estimate emissions arising from rural- to-urban migration and population growth within cities, utilizing quantifications of urbanization for the SSPs (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017). In addition, spatial patterns of future rural and urban population growth, migration, and decline have been quantified for the SSPs using a gravity model (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017). However, linking these spatial patterns with IAM regional emissions pathways is still an ongoing area of study and has not yet been represented in spatial emissions estimates provided by IAMs (Riahi et al., 2017; Gidden et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020). As described in Feng et al. (2020), spatial emissions estimates derived for CMIP6 are largely a product of existing spatial patterns of population, but do not vary dynamically in future patterns. To the extent urbanization is accounted for in gridded emissions, IAM native region resolution (varying, for example, from 11 world regions to more than 30, depending on the model) provides urbanization-based dynamics. Despite the interest of studying the effect of well-planned, densely populated urban centres, which can help to maximize the benefits of agglomeration, by providing proximity to infrastructure and services, the opportunity for energy saving, and providing a frame for air-quality control, IAM realizations of SSPs are not sufficient to assess this effect. The opportunities and risks associated with this rapid urbanization for SLCF emissions and air quality are analysed in the Chapter 6 of the WGII report and Chapter 8 of the WGIII report."
AR6_WG1_6_26,6,63,"estimates for the post-2000 period (Hoesly et al., 2018) and those used in RCPs (Figure 6.18). Since several SLCFs are also air pollutants, the narrow range of the RCP emissions trajectories in the future allowed for only limited analysis of near-future air quality (Amann et al., 2013; Chuwah et al., 2013; von Schneidemesser et al., 2015). However, the range of storylines in the SSPs lead to a wider range of assumed pollution-control policies in the SSPs (Rao et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017). In SSP1 and SSP5, strong air-quality policies are assumed to minimize the adverse effects of pollution on population and ecosystems. In SSP2, a medium pollution control, with lower than current policy targets, is considered. Only weak, regionally varied, air pollution policies are applied in the SSP3 and SSP4. Additional climate policies introduced to reach defined radiative forcing targets will also affect SLCF emissions. The SSP SLCF-emissions trajectories (Rao et al., 2017; Gidden et al., 2019) assume a long-term coupling of economic growth and specific emissions INDICATORs, such as sectoral emission densities. The pace of change varies across regions and SSPs resulting in a wider range of future air pollutants evolution (Figure 6.18), reflecting the differences in assumed levels of air pollution controls across regions (Figure 6.19). At the end of the century, the range across the SSPs is about four times that of RCPs for SO and NO , two to four times for BC and NMVOCs, and up to three times for CO and OC, while INDICating a slightly smaller range than RCPs for methane (Figure 6.18). The originally developed SSP scenarios (Rao et al., 2017) have been harmonized with the CMIP6 historical emissions (Hoesly et al., 2018) and include updated SO emissions to account for the recent decline in China (Gidden et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_6_27,6,65,"An additional scenario, based on the SSP3-7.0, has been designed specifically to assess the effect of a strong SLCF emissions abatement and is called SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF in the literature (Collins et al., 2017; Gidden et al., 2019). It has been applied in the modelling studies (e.g., AerChemMIP) with or without consideration of additional methane reduction and we refer here to these scenarios, respectively, as SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-lowCH or SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH . In these scenarios, aerosols, their precursors, and non-methane tropospheric ozone precursors are mitigated by applying the same emissions factors as in SSP1-1.9. For global methane emissions, the range is similar for SSPs and RCPs over the entire century (Figure 6.18), with highest projections in SSP3-7.0 (slightly below RCP8.5) estimating doubling of the current emissions and a reduction of about 75% by 2100 in scenarios consistent with 1.5°C to 2°C targets; similar to RCP2.6. At the regional level, the evolution of methane emissions in climate change mitigation scenarios is comparable to RCPs but there are significant differences for some regions with respect to high CO emissions scenarios. In particular, projections for Eastern Asia differ significantly, the highest SSP3-7.0 is about half of the highest RCP by 2100 (Figure 6.19), which is due to much lower projections of coal use in China driven largely by efforts during the last decade to combat poor air quality. At the same time, the SSP scenarios without climate change mitigation project faster growth in methane emissions in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America (Figure 6.19) driven by developments in agriculture, the oil and gas sectors, and, especially in Africa, waste management. There are significant differences in the assessment and feasibility of rapid methane mitigation. Höglund-Isaksson et al. (2020) review most recent studies and assess feasibility of rapid widespread mitigation, concluding that significant (over 50%) reductions are attainable but the feasibility of such reductions could be constrained in the short term due to locked capital. This might have implications for near-term evolution assumed in, for example, SSP1-1.9 or SSP3-lowSLCF-lowCH , where emissions drop very quickly due to fast decarbonization and reductions in agriculture. Such high reduction potential in agriculture has been also assumed in other studies (Lucas et al., 2007; Harmsen et al., 2020a) but is questioned by Höglund-Isaksson et al. (2020) who INDICate that widespread implementation (within decades) of policies bringing about institutional and behavioural changes would be important for transition towards very low methane emissions from livestock production."
AR6_WG1_6_28,6,73,"To assess the effect of dedicated air-quality versus climate policy on air quality, PM and ozone INDICATORs were estimated for three SSP3 scenarios by applying a widely used approach for the analysis of air-quality implications for given emissions scenarios (Rao et al., 2017; Van Dingenen et al., 2018; Vandyck et al., 2018) and whose sensitivity of surface concentrations to emissions changes is comparable to that in the ESM ensemble (Supplementary Material 6.SM.5). The assessment shows that both strong air pollution control and strong climate change mitigation, implemented independently, lead to a large reduction of exposure to PM and ozone by the end of the century (high confidence) (Figures 6.25 and 6.26). However, implementation of air pollution control, relying on the deployment of existing technologies, leads to benefits more rapidly than climate change mitigation (high confidence), which requires systemic changes and is thus implemented later in this scenario. Notably, under the underlying SSP3 context, significant parts of the population remain exposed to air quality exceeding the WHO guidelines for PM over the whole century (high confidence), in particular in Africa, Eastern and Southern Asia and the Middle East, and for ozone only a small improvement in population exposure is expected in Africa and Asia."
AR6_WG1_7_1,7,7,"Throughout this chapter, global surface air temperature (GSAT) is used to quantify surface temperature change (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 and Section 4.3.4). The total energy accumulation in the Earth system represents a metric of global change that is complementary to GSAT but shows considerably less variability on interannual-to-decadal time scales (Section 7.2.2). Research and new observations since AR5 have improved scientific confidence in the quantification of changes in the global energy inventory and corresponding estimates of Earth’s energy imbalance (Section 7.2). Improved understanding of adjustments to radiative forcing and of aerosol–cloud interactions have led to revisions of forcing estimates (Section 7.3). New approaches to the quantification and treatment of feedbacks (Section 7.4) have improved the understanding of their nature and time-evolution, leading to a better understanding of how these feedbacks relate to equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). This has helped to reconcile disparate estimates of ECS from different lines of evidence (Section 7.5). Innovations in the use of emissions metrics have clarified the relationships between metric choice and temperature policy goals (Section 7.6), linking this chapter to WGIII which provides further information on metrics, their use, and policy goals beyond temperature. Very likely (5–95%) ranges are presented unless otherwise INDICated. In particular, the addition of ‘(one standard deviation)’ INDICates that the range represents one standard deviation.

AR6_WG1_7_2,7,9,"Given that TCR and ECS are metrics of GSAT response to a theoretical doubling of atmospheric CO (Box 7.1), they do not directly correspond to the warming that would occur under realistic forcing scenarios that include time-varying CO concentrations and non-CO forcing agents (such as aerosols and land-use changes). It has been argued that TCR, as a metric of transient warming, is more policy-relevant than ECS (Frame et al., 2006; Schwartz, 2018). However, as detailed in Chapter 4, both established and recent results (Forster et al., 2013; Gregory et al., 2015; Marotzke and Forster, 2015; Grose et al., 2018; Marotzke, 2019) INDICate that TCR and ECS help explain variation across climate models both over the historical period and across a range of concentration-driven future scenarios. In emission-driven scenarios the carbon cycle response is also important (Smith et al., 2019). The proportion of variation explained by ECS and TCR varies with scenario and the time period considered, but both past and future surface warming depend on these metrics (Section 7.5.7)."
AR6_WG1_7_3,7,13,"The AR5 (Church et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2013; Myhre et al., 2013b) highlighted the progress that had been made in quantifying the TOA radiation budget following new satellite observations that became available in the early 21st century (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System, CERES; Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment, SORCE). Progress in the quantification of changes in incoming solar radiation at the TOA is discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.2). Since AR5, the CERES Energy Balance EBAF Ed4.0 product was released, which includes algorithm improvements and consistent input datasets throughout the record (Loeb et al., 2018b). However, the overall precision of these fluxes (uncertainty in global mean TOA flux of 1.7% (1.7 W m –2 ) for reflected solar and 1.3% (3.0 W m –2 ) for outgoing thermal radiation at the 90% confidence level) is not sufficient to quantify the Earth’s energy imbalance in absolute terms. Therefore, the CERES EBAF reflected solar and emitted thermal TOA fluxes were adjusted, within the estimated uncertainties, to ensure that the net TOA flux for July 2005 to June 2015 was consistent with the estimated Earth’s energy imbalance for the same period based on ocean heat content (OHC) measurements and energy uptake estimates for the land, cryosphere and atmosphere (Section 7.2.2.2; Johnson et al., 2016; Riser et al., 2016). ESMs typically show good agreement with global mean TOA fluxes from CERES-EBAF. However, as some ESMs are known to calibrate their TOA fluxes to CERES or similar data (Hourdin et al., 2017), this is not necessarily an INDICation of model accuracy, especially as ESMs show significant discrepancies on regional scales, often related to their representation of clouds (Trenberth and Fasullo, 2010; Donohoe and Battisti, 2012; Hwang and Frierson, 2013; J.-L.F. Li et al., 2013; Dolinar et al., 2015; Wild et al., 2015)."
AR6_WG1_7_4,7,15,"In summary, variations in the energy exchange between Earth and space can be accurately tracked since the advent of improved observations since the year 2000 (high confidence), while reconstructions INDICate that the Earth’s energy imbalance was larger in the 2000s than in the 1985–1999 period (high confidence)."
AR6_WG1_7_5,7,16,"Since AR5, additional evidence for dimming and/or subsequent brightening up to several percent per decade, based on direct surface observations, has been documented in previously less-studied areas of the globe, such as Iran, Bahrain, Tenerife, Hawaii, the Taklaman Desert and the Tibetan Plateau (Elagib and Alvi, 2013; You et al., 2013; Garcia et al., 2014; Longman et al., 2014; Rahimzadeh et al., 2015). Strong decadal trends in surface solar radiation remain evident after careful data quality assessment and homogenization of long-term records (Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2013, 2015; Manara et al., 2015, 2016; Wang et al., 2015; Z. Li et al., 2016; Wang and Wild, 2016; Y. He et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018). Since AR5, new studies on the potential effects of urbanization on solar radiation trends INDICate that these effects are generally small, with the exception of some specific sites in Russia and China (Wang et al., 2014; Imamovic et al., 2016; Tanaka et al., 2016). Also, surface-based solar radiation observations have been shown to be representative over large spatial domains of up to several degrees latitude/longitude on monthly and longer time scales (Hakuba et al., 2014; Schwarz et al., 2018). Thus, there is high confidence that the observed dimming between the 1950s and 1980s and the subsequent brightening are robust and do not arise from measurement artefacts or localized phenomena."
AR6_WG1_7_6,7,16,"As noted in AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013) and supported by recent studies, the trends in surface solar radiation are less spatially coherent since the beginning of the 21st century, with evidence for continued brightening in parts of Europe and the USA, some stabilization in China and India, and dimming in other areas (Augustine and Dutton, 2013; Sanchez- Lorenzo et al., 2015; Manara et al., 2016; Soni et al., 2016; Wang and Wild, 2016; Jahani et al., 2018; Pfeifroth et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Schwarz et al., 2020). The CERES-EBAF satellite-derived dataset of surface solar radiation (Kato et al., 2018) does not INDICate a globally significant trend over the short period 2001–2012 (Zhang et al., 2015), whereas a statistically significant increase in surface solar radiation of +3.4 W m −2 per decade over the period 1996–2010 has been found in the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) record of the geostationary satellite Meteosat, which views Europe, Africa and adjacent ocean (Posselt et al., 2014)."
AR6_WG1_7_7,7,17,"Turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat are also an important part of the surface energy budget (Figure 7.2). Large uncertainties in measurements of surface turbulent fluxes continue to prevent the determination of their decadal changes. Nevertheless, over the ocean, reanalysis-based estimates of linear trends from 1948–2008 INDICate high spatial variability and seasonality. Increases in magnitudes of 4 to 7 W m –2 per decade for latent heat and 2 to 3 W m –2 per decade for sensible heat in the western boundary current regions are mostly balanced by decreasing trends in other regions (Gulev and Belyaev, 2012). Over land, the terrestrial latent heat flux is estimated to have increased in magnitude by 0.09 W m –2 per decade from 1989–1997, and subsequently decreased by 0.13 W m –2 per decade from 1998–2005 due to soil-moisture limitation mainly in the Southern Hemisphere (derived from Mueller et al., 2013). These trends are small in comparison to the uncertainty associated with satellite-derived and in situ observations, as well as from land-surface models forced by observations and atmospheric reanalyses. Ongoing advances in remote sensing of evapotranspiration from space (Mallick et al., 2016; Fisher et al., 2017; McCabe et al., 2017a, b), as well as terrestrial water storage (Rodell et al., 2018) may contribute to future constraints on changes in latent heat flux."

However, it is now well-documented that the latter approach leads to low estimates of IRFaci since AOD is a poor proxy for cloud-base CCN (Penner et al., 2011; Stier, 2016). Gryspeerdt et al. (2017) demonstrated that the statistical relationship between droplet concentration and AOD leads to an inferred IRFaci that is underestimated by at least 30%, while the use of AI leads to estimates of IRFaci to within ±20%, if the anthropogenic perturbation of AI is known."

AR6_WG1_7_10,7,52,"Arctic cloud feedback Clouds in polar regions, especially over the Arctic, form at low altitude above or within a stable to neutral boundary layer and are known to co-vary with sea ice variability beneath. Because the clouds reflect sunlight during summer but trap LW radiation throughout the year, seasonality plays an important role in cloud effects on Arctic climate (Kay et al., 2016b). AR5 assessed that Arctic low-cloud amount will increase in boreal autumn and winter in response to declining sea ice in a warming climate, due primarily to an enhanced upward moisture flux over open water. The cloudier conditions during these seasons result in more downwelling LW radiation, acting as a positive feedback on surface warming (Kay and Gettelman, 2009). Over recent years, further evidence of the cloud contribution to the Arctic amplification has been obtained (Section 7.4.4.1; Goosse et al., 2018). Space-borne lidar (light detection and ranging) observations show that the cloud response to summer sea ice loss is small and cannot overcome the cloud effect in autumn (Taylor et al., 2015; Morrison et al., 2019). The seasonality of the cloud response to sea ice variability is reproduced in GCM simulations (Laîné et al., 2016; Yoshimori et al., 2017). The agreement between observations and models INDICates that the Arctic cloud feedback is positive at the surface. This leads to an Arctic cloud feedback at TOA that is likely positive, but very small in magnitude, as found in some climate models (Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014; Morrison et al., 2019). The observational estimates are sensitive to the analysis period and the choice of reanalysis data, and a recent estimate of the TOA cloud feedback over 60°N–90°N using atmospheric reanalysis data and CERES satellite observations suggests a regional value ranging from –0.3 to +0.5 W m –2 °C –1 , which corresponds to a global contribution of –0.02 to +0.03 W m –2 °C –1 (R. Zhang et al., 2018). Based on the overall agreement between ESMs and observations, the Arctic cloud feedback is assessed to be small positive and has the value of 0.01 ± 0.05 W m –2 °C –1 (one standard deviation). The assessed range INDICates that a negative feedback is almost as probable as a positive feedback, and the assessment that the Arctic cloud feedback is positive is therefore given low confidence."
AR6_WG1_7_11,7,54,"7.4.2.5.2 Biogeophysical feedbacks Biogeophysical feedbacks are associated with changes in the spatial distribution and/or biophysical properties of vegetation, induced by surface temperature change and attendant hydrological cycle change. These vegetation changes can alter radiative fluxes directly via albedo changes, or via surface momentum or moisture flux changes and hence changes in cloud properties. However, the direct physiological response of vegetation to changes in CO , including changes in stomatal conductance, is considered part of the CO effective radiative forcing rather than a feedback (Section 7.3.2.1). The time scale on which vegetation responds to climate change is relatively uncertain but can be from decades to hundreds of years (Willeit et al., 2014), and could occur abruptly or as a tipping point (Sections 5.4.9.1.1, 8.6.2.1 and 8.6.2.2); equilibrium only occurs when the soil system and associated nutrient and carbon pools equilibrate, which can take millennia (Brantley, 2008; Sitch et al., 2008). The overall effects of climate-induced vegetation changes may be comparable in magnitude to those from anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change (Davies-Barnard et al., 2015). Climate models that include a dynamical representation of vegetation (e.g., Reick et al., 2013; Harper et al., 2018) are used to explore the importance of biogeophysical feedbacks (Notaro et al., 2007; Brovkin et al., 2009; O’ishi et al., 2009; Port et al., 2012; Willeit et al., 2014; Alo and Anagnostou, 2017; W. Zhang et al., 2018; Armstrong et al., 2019). In AR5, it was discussed that such model experiments predicted that expansion of vegetation in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere would enhance warming due to the associated surface- albedo change, and that reduction of tropical forests in response to climate change would lead to regional surface warming, due to reduced evapotranspiration (M. Collins et al., 2013), but there was no assessment of the associated feedback parameter. The SRCCL stated that regional climate change can be dampened or enhanced by changes in local land cover, but that this depends on the location and the season; however, in general the focus was on anthropogenic land- cover change, and no assessment of the biogeophysical feedback parameter was carried out. There are also INDICations of a marine biogeophysical feedback associated with surface-albedo change due to changes in phytoplankton (Frouin and Iacobellis, 2002; Park et al., 2015), but there is not currently enough evidence to quantitatively assess this feedback."
AR6_WG1_7_12,7,54,"Since AR5, several studies have confirmed that a shift from tundra to boreal forests and the associated albedo change leads to increased warming in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes (high confidence) (Willeit et al., 2014; W. Zhang et al., 2018; Armstrong et al., 2019). However, regional modelling INDICates that vegetation feedbacks may act to cool climate in the Mediterranean (Alo and Anagnostou, 2017), and in the tropics and subtropics the regional response is in general not consistent across models. On a global scale, several modelling studies have either carried out a feedback analysis (Stocker et al., 2013; Willeit et al., 2014) or presented simulations that allow a feedback parameter to be estimated (O’ishi et al., 2009; Armstrong et al., 2019), in such a way that the physiological response can be accounted for as a forcing rather than a feedback. The central estimates of the biogeophysical feedback parameter from these studies range from close to zero (Willeit et al., 2014) to +0.13 W m –2 °C –1 (Stocker et al., 2013). An additional line of evidence comes from the mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP, Chapter 2, Cross-Chapter Box 2.1), for which paleoclimate proxies provide evidence of vegetation distribution and CO concentrations. Model simulations that include various combinations of modern versus MPWP vegetation and CO allow an associated feedback parameter to be estimated, as long as account is also taken of the orographic forcing (Lunt et al., 2010, 2012b). This approach has the advantage over pure modelling studies in that the reconstructed vegetation is based on (paleoclimate) observations, and is in equilibrium with the CO forcing. However, there are uncertainties in the vegetation reconstruction in regions with little or no proxy data, and it is uncertain how much of the vegetation change is associated with the physiological response to CO . This paleoclimate approach gives an estimate for the biogeophysical feedback parameter of +0.3 W m –2 °C –1 ."
AR6_WG1_7_13,7,55,"The magnitude of the radiative feedback associated with changes to ice sheets can be quantified by comparing the global mean long-term equilibrium temperature response to increased CO concentrations in simulations that include interactive ice sheets with that of simulations that do not include the associated ice sheet–climate interactions (Swingedouw et al., 2008; Vizcaíno et al., 2010; Goelzer et al., 2011; Bronselaer et al., 2018; Golledge et al., 2019). These simulations INDICate that on multi-centennial time scales, ice-sheet mass loss leads to freshwater fluxes that can modify ocean circulation (Swingedouw et al., 2008; Goelzer et al., 2011; Bronselaer et al., 2018; Golledge et al., 2019). This leads to reduced surface warming (by about 0.2°C in the global mean after 1000 years; Section 7.4.4.1.1; Goelzer et al., 2011), although other work suggests no net global temperature effect of ice-sheet mass loss (Vizcaíno et al., 2010). However, model simulations in which the Antarctic Ice Sheet is removed completely in a paleoclimate context INDICate a positive global mean feedback on multi-millennial time scales due primarily to the surface-albedo change (Goldner et al., 2014a; Kennedy-Asser et al., 2019); in Chapter 9 (Section 9.6.3) it is assessed that such ice-free conditions could eventually occur given 7°C–13°C of warming. This net positive feedback from ice-sheet mass loss on long time scales is also supported by model simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP; Cross-chapter Box 2.1) in which the volume and area of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are reduced in model simulations in agreement with geological data (Chandan and Peltier, 2018), leading to surface warming. As such, overall, on multi- centennial time scales the feedback parameter associated with ice sheets is likely negative (medium confidence), but on multi-millennial time scales by the time the ice sheets reach equilibrium, the feedback parameter is very likely positive (high confidence) (Table 7.10). However, a relative lack of models carrying out simulations with and without interactive ice sheets over centennial to millennial time scales means that there is currently not enough evidence to quantify the magnitude of these feedbacks, or the time scales on which they act."

It is virtually certain that the net climate feedback is negative, primarily due to the Planck temperature response, INDICating that climate acts to stabilize in response to radiative forcing imposed to the system. Supported by the level of confidence associated with the individual feedbacks, it is also virtually certain that the sum of the non-Planck feedbacks is positive. Based on Table 7.10 these climate feedbacks amplify the Planck temperature response by about 2.8 [1.9 to 5.9] times. Cloud feedback remains the largest contributor to uncertainty of the net feedback, but the uncertainty is reduced compared to AR5. A secondary contribution to the net feedback uncertainty is the biogeophysical and non-CO biogeochemical feedbacks, which together are assessed to have a central value near zero and thus do not affect the central estimate of ECS. The net climate feedback is assessed to be –1.16 W m –2 °C –1 , likely from –1.54 to –0.78 W m –2 °C –1 , and very likely from –1.81 to –0.51 W m –2 °C –1 ."
AR6_WG1_7_15,7,56,"Feedback parameters in climate models are calculated assuming that they are independent of each other, except for a well-known co-dependency between the water vapour (WV) and lapse rate (LR) feedbacks. When the inter-model spread of the net climate feedback is computed by adding in quadrature the inter-model spread of individual feedbacks, it is 17% wider than the spread of the net climate feedback directly derived from the ensemble. This INDICates that the feedbacks in climate models are partly co-dependent. Two possible co-dependencies have been suggested (Huybers, 2010; Caldwell et al., 2016). One is a negative covariance between the LR and longwave cloud feedbacks, which may be accompanied by a deepening of the troposphere (O’Gorman and Singh, 2013; Yoshimori et al., 2020) leading both to greater rising of high-clouds and a larger upper-tropospheric warming. The other is a negative covariance between albedo and shortwave cloud feedbacks, which may originate from the Arctic regions: a reduction in sea ice enhances the shortwave cloud radiative effect because the ocean surface is darker than sea ice (Gilgen et al., 2018). This covariance is reinforced as the decrease of sea ice leads to an increase in low-level clouds (Mauritsen et al., 2013). However, the mechanism causing these co-dependences between feedbacks is not well understood yet and a quantitative assessment based on multiple lines of evidence is difficult. Therefore, this synthesis assessment does not consider any co-dependency across individual feedbacks. The assessment of the net climate feedback presented above is based on a single approach (i.e., process understanding) and directly results in a value for ECS given in Section 7.5.1; this is in contrast to the synthesis assessment of ECS in Section 7.5.5 which combines multiple approaches. The total (net) feedback parameter consistent with the final synthesis assessment of the ECS and Equation 7.1 (Box 7.1) is provided there."
AR6_WG1_7_16,7,58,"Overall, the modelling evidence INDICates that there is medium α, confidence that the net feedback parameter, increases (i.e., becomes less negative) with increasing temperature (i.e., that sensitivity to forcing increases with increasing temperature), under global surface background temperatures at least up to 40°C (Meraner et al., 2013; Seeley and Jeevanjee, 2021), and medium confidence that this temperature dependence primarily derives from increases in the water-vapour and shortwave cloud feedbacks. This assessment is further supported by recent analysis of CMIP6 model simulations (Bloch-Johnson et al., 2020) in the framework of nonlinMIP (Good et al., 2016), which showed that out of 10 CMIP6 models, seven of them showed an increase of the net feedback parameter with temperature, primarily due to the water-vapour feedback."

Furthermore, many of these glacial–interglacial studies estimate a very strong α temperature-dependence of (Figure 7.11) that is hard to reconcile with the other lines of evidence, including proxy estimates from warmer paleoclimates. However, if the analysis excludes time periods when the temperature and CO data are not well correlated, which occurs in general at times when sea level is falling and obliquity is decreasing, the state-dependence reduces (Köhler et al., 2018). Despite these uncertainties, due to the agreement in the sign of the temperature-dependence from all these studies, there is medium confidence from the paleoclimate proxy record that the net feedback α, parameter, was less negative in the warm periods than in the cold periods of the glacial–interglacial cycles."

ESM simulations INDICate that freshwater input from melting ice shelves could reduce Southern Ocean warming by up to several tenths of a °C over the 21st century by increasing stratification of the surface ocean around Antarctica (low confidence due to medium agreement but limited evidence) (Sections 7.4.2.6 and 9.2.1, and Box 9.3; Bronselaer et al., 2018; Golledge et al., 2019; Lago and England, 2019). However, even a large reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and associated northward heat transport due, for instance, to greatly increased freshwater runoff from Greenland would be insufficient to eliminate Arctic amplification (medium confidence based on medium agreement and medium evidence) (Liu et al., 2017; Y. Liu et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_7_19,7,63,"At the time of AR5, polar amplification was evident in proxy reconstructions of paleoclimate sea surface temperature (SST) and surface air temperature (SAT) from the LGM, MPWP and the Early Eocene, but uncertainties associated with proxy calibrations (Waelbroeck et al., 2009; Dowsett et al., 2012; Lunt et al., 2012a) and the role of orbital forcing (for the MPWP; Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) meant that the degree of polar amplification during these time periods was not accurately known. Furthermore, although some models (CCSM3; Winguth et al., 2010; Huber and Caballero, 2011) at that time were able to reproduce the strong polar amplification implied by temperature proxies of the Early Eocene, this was achieved at higher CO concentrations (>2000 ppm) than those INDICated by CO proxies (<1500 ppm; Beerling and Royer, 2011)."

In support of these initial findings, a more recent (CMIP5) climate model, that includes a process-based representation of cloud microphysics, exhibits polar amplification in better agreement with proxies when compared to the models assessed in AR5 (Zhu et al., 2019a). Since then, some other CMIP3 and CMIP5 models in the DeepMIP multi-model ensemble (Lunt et al., 2021) have obtained polar amplification for the EECO that is consistent with proxy INDICations of both polar amplification and CO .

This enhanced warming in the east Pacific cold tongue appears to be dynamically consistent with reconstruction of enhanced subsurface warming (Ford et al., 2015) and enhanced warming in coastal upwelling regions, suggesting that the tropical thermocline was deeper and/or less stratified during the Pliocene. The Pliocene data therefore suggest that the observed cooling trend over the last 60 years in parts of the eastern equatorial Pacific (Section 9.2.1.1 and Figure 9.3; Seager et al., 2019), whether forced or due to internal variability, involves transient processes that are probably distinct from the longer-time scale process (Burls and Fedorov, 2014a, b; Luo et al., 2015; Heede et al., 2020) that maintained warmer eastern Pacific SST during the Pliocene. 7.4.4.2.3 Overall assessment of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature gradients under CO forcing The paleoclimate proxy record and ESM simulations of the MPWP, process understanding, and ESM projections of climate response to CO forcing provide medium evidence and a medium agreement and thus medium confidence that equilibrium warming in response to elevated CO will be characterized by a weakening of the east–west tropical Pacific SST gradient."
AR6_WG1_7_23,7,67,"The expected time-evolution of the spatial pattern of surface warming in the future has important implications for values of ECS inferred from the historical record of observed warming. In particular, changes in the global top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative energy budget can be induced by changes in the regional variations of surface temperature, even without a change in the global mean temperature (Zhou et al., 2016; Ceppi and Gregory, 2019). Consequently, the global radiative feedback, characterizing the net TOA radiative response to global surface warming, depends on the spatial pattern of that warming. Therefore, if the equilibrium warming pattern under CO forcing (similar to CMIP6 projections in Figure 7.12a) is distinct from that observed over the historical record or INDICated by paleoclimate proxies (Sections 7.4.4.1 and 7.4.4.2), then ECS will be different from the effective ECS (Box 7.1) that is inferred from those periods. Accounting for the dependence of radiative feedbacks on the spatial pattern of warming has helped to reconcile values of ECS inferred from the historical record with values of ECS based on other lines of evidence and simulated by climate models (Section 7.5.2.1; Armour, 2017; Proistosescu and Huybers, 2017; Andrews et al., 2018) but has not yet been examined in the paleoclimate context."

However, historical simulations with HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL (Andrews et al., 2019) and GFDL CM4.0 (Winton et al., 2020) show substantial spread in the value of α’ across ensemble members, INDICating a potentially important role for internal variability in setting the magnitude of the pattern effect over the historical period. Using the 100-member historical simulation ensemble of MPI-ESM1.1, Dessler et al.

Moreover, paleoclimate proxies, ESM simulations, and process understanding INDICate that strong warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (with medium confidence) and Southern Ocean (with high confidence) will emerge on centennial time scales as the response to CO forcing dominates temperature changes in these regions (Sections 7.4.4.1, 7.4.4.2 and 9.2.1). However, there is low confidence that these features, which have been largely absent over the historical record, will emerge this century (Sections 7.4.4.1, 7.4.4.2 and Section 9.2.1). This leads to high confidence that radiative feedbacks will become less negative as the CO -forced pattern of surface warming emerges (α’ > 0 W m –2 °C –1 ), but low confidence that these feedback changes will be realized this century. There is also substantial uncertainty in the magnitude of the net radiative feedback change between the present warming pattern and the projected equilibrium warming pattern in response to CO forcing owing to the fact that its quantification currently relies solely on ESM results and is subject to uncertainties in historical SST patterns. α’ Thus, based on the pattern of warming since 1870, is estimated to be in the range 0.0 to 1.0 W m –2 °C –1 but with a low confidence in α’ the upper end of this range.

In the real world, natural internal variability and aerosol radiative forcing also affect the efficacy parameter, but these effects are excluded for the current discussion. The analytical solution of the energy balance emulator reveals that the global surface temperature change to abrupt increase of the atmospheric CO concentration is expressed by a combination of a fast adjustment of the surface components of the climate system and a slow response of the deep ocean, with time scales of several years and several centuries, respectively (grey curve in Figure 7.17b). The equilibrium response of upper ocean temperature, approximating SST and the surface air temperature response, depends, by definition, only on the radiative forcing and the net α feedback parameter. Uncertainty in dominates (80–90%) the corresponding uncertainty range for ECS in CMIP5 models (Vial et al., 2013), and also an increase of ECS in CMIP6 models (Section 7.5.5) α is attributed by about 60–80% to a change in (Zelinka et al., α 2020). For the range of TCR, the contribution from uncertainty in is reduced to 50–60% while uncertainty in ΔF becomes relatively more important (Geoffroy et al., 2012; Lutsko and Popp, 2019). TCR reflects the fast response occurring approximately during the first 20 years in the abrupt4xCO2 simulation (Held et al., 2010), but the fast response is not independent of the slow response because there is a non-linear co-dependence between them (Andrews et al., 2015). The non-linear relationship between ECS and TCR INDICates that the probability of high TCR is not very sensitive to changes in the probability of high ECS (Meehl et al., 2020)."

While several lines of evidence INDICate that > 0, the quantitative accuracy of feedback changes is not known at this time (Section 7.4.4.3). Global energy budget constraints thus provide high confidence in the lower bound of ECS which is not sensitive to the α’: value of ECS is extremely unlikely to be less than 1.6°C. Estimates α’ of that are informed by idealized CO forcing simulations of coupled ESMs (Armour, 2017; Lewis and Curry, 2018; Andrews et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2020; Winton et al., 2020) INDICate a median value α’ of ECS of around 2.7°C while estimates of that are informed by observed historical sea surface temperature patterns (Andrews et al., 2018) INDICate a median value of ECS of around 3.5°C.

However, there is robust evidence and high agreement across the lines of evidence that ECS is extremely likely greater than 1.6°C (high confidence). There is robust evidence and medium agreement across the lines of evidence that ECS is very likely greater than 1.8°C and likely greater than 2.2°C (high confidence). These ranges of ECS correspond to estimates based on historical global energy budget constraints (Section 7.5.2.1) under the assumption of no feedback dependence on evolving SST α’ patterns (i.e., = 0) and thus represent an underestimate of the true ECS ranges that can be inferred from this line of evidence (high confidence). Historical global energy budget changes do not provide constraints on the upper bound of ECS, while the studies assessed in Section 7.5.2.3 based on climate variability provide low confidence in its value owing to limited evidence.

Given the higher values from many glacial–interglacial studies, this value has only medium confidence. Despite the large variation in individual studies at the extreme upper end, all except two studies (both of which are from glacial–interglacial time periods associated with low confidence) have central estimates that are below 6°C; overall we assess that it is extremely likely that ECS is below 8°C (high confidence)."

These studies yield median ECS estimates of 3.5°C–4°C and in many cases INDICate low likelihoods of values below 3°C. The approach has attracted attention since most of the spread in climate sensitivity seen in CMIP5, and earlier climate model ensembles, arises from uncertainty in low-cloud feedbacks (Bony and Dufresne, 2005; Wyant et al., 2006; Randall et al., 2007; Vial et al., 2013). Nevertheless, this approach assumes that all other feedback processes are unbiased (Klein and Hall, 2015; Qu et al., 2018; Schlund et al., 2020), for instance the possibly missing negative anvil area feedback or the possibly exaggerated mixed- phase cloud feedback (Section 7.4.2.4). Thus, the subset of emergent constraints that focus on low-level tropical clouds are not necessarily inconsistent with other emergent constraints of ECS. Related emergent constraints that focus on aspects of the tropical circulation and ECS have led to conflicting results (Su et al., 2014; Tian, 2015; Lipat et al., 2017; Webb and Lock, 2020), possibly because these processes are not the dominant factors in causing the inter-model spread (Caldwell et al., 2018)."

Considering both classes of studies, none of them yield upper very likely bounds above 5°C. Since several of the emergent constraints can be considered nearly independent one could assume that emergent constraints provide very strong evidence on ECS by combining them. Nevertheless, this is not done here because there are sufficient cross-dependencies, as for instance models are re-used in many of the derived emergent constraints, and furthermore the methodology has not yet reached a sufficient level of maturity since systematic biases may not have been accounted for. Uncertainty is therefore conservatively added to reflect these potential issues. This leads to the assessment that ECS inferred from emergent constraints is very likely 1.5 to 5 °C with medium confidence."

Heavy precipitation shows a global tendency to increase more at 2°C compared to 1.5°C, though there is low confidence in projected regional differences in heavy precipitation at 1.5°C compared to 2°C global warming, except at high latitudes or at high altitude where there is medium confidence. A key finding is that ‘limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C would approximately halve the proportion of the world population expected to suffer water scarcity, although there is considerable variability between regions (medium confidence)’ (SR1.5). This is consistent with greater adverse impacts found at 2°C compared to 1.5°C for a number of dryness or drought INDICES (Schleussner et al., 2016; Lehner et al., 2017; Greve et al., 2018). There is also medium confidence that land areas with increased runoff and exposure to flood hazards will increase more at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming."
AR6_WG1_8_2,8,9,"The Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable management, food security, and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL) has clear connections with the water cycle. This Report INDICates that since 1850–1900, land surface temperature has risen nearly twice as much as global surface temperature (high confidence), with an increase in dry climates (high confidence). Land surface processes modulate the likelihood, intensity and duration of many extreme events including droughts (medium confidence) and heavy precipitation (medium confidence). The direction and magnitude of hydrological changes induced by land use change and land surface feedbacks vary with location and season (high confidence). Desertification exacerbates climate change through feedbacks involving vegetation cover, greenhouse gases and mineral dust aerosol (high confidence). Urbanization increases extreme rainfall events over or downwind of cities (medium confidence). Intensification of rainy events increase their consequences on land degradation."

Irrigation can explain declining groundwater storage in some regions, including north-western India and North America (Asoka et al., 2017; G. Ferguson et al., 2018). Simulations spanning 1960–2010 INDICate that approximately 30% of the present human water consumption is supplied from non-sustainable water resources (Wada and Bierkens, 2014). However, there is only limited evidence that groundwater extraction is lowering streamflow (Mukherjee et al., 2018; de Graaf et al., 2019). Model experiments show that irrigation can either aggravate or alleviate climate‐induced changes of surface or subsurface water (Leng et al., 2015). Widespread extraction of water from rivers can reduce flows and decrease the level and area of inland seas and lakes (Wurtsbaugh et al., 2017; Torres-Batlló et al., 2020; X. Wang et al., 2020). Between 1985 and 2015, about 139,000 km 2 of inland water areas have become land, while creation of dams has converted about 95,000 km 2 of land to water, particularly in the Amazon and Tibetan Plateau (Donchyts et al., 2016). Direct management of river flow is comparable in magnitude to climate change effects for snow-fed rivers at a continental scale based on a global analysis and a study of 96 Canadian catchments (Tan and Gan, 2015; Arheimer et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_8_4,8,22,"In summary, there is high confidence that land-use change and water extraction for irrigation drive local, regional and remote responses in the water cycle. Large-scale deforestation is likely to decrease precipitation over the deforested regions but there is low confidence in the effects of limited deforestation. There is medium confidence that deforestation drives increased streamflow relative to the responses caused by climate change. Urbanization can increase local precipitation (medium confidence) and resulting runoff intensity (high confidence). A warming climate combined with direct human demand for water is expected to deplete groundwater resources in dry regions (high confidence). Cycle Changes the shortwave and longwave radiation and influencing cloud available for surface evaporation and subsequent precipitation. to space directly by the aerosols and indirectly by the aerosol INDICate decreasing precipitation trends during the 1950s to the et al., 2020). These changes are attributable with high confidence causing dimming through reduced surface solar radiation."
AR6_WG1_8_5,8,26,"This pattern is consistent with our theoretical understanding of human-induced changes in the water cycle, leading to the conclusion that these changes are very likely the result of anthropogenic forcings (Section 9.2.2.2). In contrast, AR5 did not provide a conclusive assessment of observed changes in P–E over land. Continental P–E estimated from reanalyses and data-driven land surface models INDICate that interannual variations are linked to ENSO (Robertson et al., 2014, 2020). Increasing trends in P–E since 1979 based on land models are not statistically significant. Observations and models show evidence that P–E increases in the wet parts and decreases in the dry parts of tropical circulation systems, which shift in location seasonally and from year to year, with increases in seasonality since 1979 (see Box 8.2; Chou et al., 2013; Liu and Allan, 2013; Fu and Feng, 2014)."
AR6_WG1_8_6,8,26,"The AR5 presented evidence of increases in global near-surface and tropospheric specific humidity since the 1970s but with medium confidence of a slowing of near-surface moistening trends over land associated with reduced relative humidity since the late 1990s. According to AR5, radiosonde, Global Positioning System (GPS) and satellite observations of tropospheric water vapour INDICate very likely increases at near global scales since the 1970s occurring at a rate that is generally consistent with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation (about 7% °C –1 at low altitudes) and the observed atmospheric warming (Hartmann et al., 2013)."
AR6_WG1_8_7,8,27,"Global and regional changes in precipitation frequency and intensity have been observed over recent decades. An analysis of 1875 rain gauge records worldwide over the period 1961–2018 INDICates that there has been a general increase in the probability of precipitation exceeding 50 mm day –1 , mostly due to an overall boost in rain intensity (Benestad et al., 2019). Such changes in precipitation intensity and frequency have not been formally attributed to human"
AR6_WG1_8_8,8,27,"activities, but are consistent with the heating effect of increasing CO levels on the distribution of daily precipitation rates (Section 8.2.3.2) and with a distinct overall intensification of heavy precipitation events found in both observations and CMIP5 models, though with an underestimated magnitude (Fischer and Knutti, 2014). Beyond amplified precipitation extremes (Section 11.4.2), CMIP5 models also INDICate that anthropogenic forcings have increased temporal variability of annual precipitation amount over land from 1950 to 2005, which is most pronounced in annual mean daily precipitation intensity (Konapala et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_8_9,8,27,"In the tropics, increases in precipitation amount are observed in convergence zones and decreases in the descending branches of the atmospheric circulation since 1979 (Chou et al., 2013; Liu and Allan, 2013; Gu et al., 2016; Polson et al., 2016; Polson and Hegerl, 2017), consistent with increased moisture transports with warming (Gimeno et al., 2020). Over tropical land areas, there is substantial variability in the ‘wet convergent regimes get wetter’ and ‘dry divergent regimes get drier’ pattern of trends observed since 1950 that are modulated by decadal changes in ENSO (Liu and Allan, 2013; Gu and Adler, 2018). CMIP6 models INDICate an increased contrast between wet and dry regions in the tropics and subtropics (Figure 8.7; Schurer et al., 2020). This provides further evidence that rainfall has increased in wet regimes, and slightly – decreased in dry regimes over the period 1988 2019 (Figure 3.14). This greater contrast is primarily attributable to greenhouse gas forcings, although the observed trends are statistically larger than the model responses (Section 3.3.2.3)."
AR6_WG1_8_10,8,28,"Over South America, there is observational and paleoclimate evidence of declining precipitation amount during the past 50 years over the Altiplano and central Chile, primarily explained by the PDO but with at least 25% of the decline attributed to anthropogenic influence (Morales et al., 2012; Neukom et al., 2015; Boisier et al., 2016; Seager et al., 2019b; Garreaud et al., 2020). In contrast, a significant rainfall increase has been detected over the Peruvian– Bolivian Altiplano (from observational data and satellite-based estimations) since the 1980s (Figure 8.7; Imfeld et al., 2020; Segura – et al., 2020). Long-term (1902 2005) precipitation data INDICate positive trends over south-eastern South America and negative trends over the southern Andes, with at least a partial contribution from anthropogenic forcing (Gonzalez et al., 2014; Vera and Díaz, 2015; Díaz and Vera, 2017; Boisier et al., 2018; Knutson and Zeng, 2018; see further assessment in Section 10.4.2.2 and Atlas.7.2.2). The Peruvian Amazon has exhibited significant rainfall decreases during the dry season since 1980 (Lavado et al., 2013; Ronchail et al., 2018). Increases in wet season rainfall in the northern and central Amazon since the 1980s and decreases during the dry season in the southern Amazon (Barreiro et al., 2014; Gloor et al., 2015; Martín-Gómez and Barreiro, 2016; J.C. Espinoza et al., 2018; X.Y. Wang et al., 2018; Haghtalab et al., 2020) are not explained by radiative forcing based on CMIP6 experiments (Figure 8.7) and trends are insignificant over longer periods since 1930 (Kumar et al., 2013) or more recently, since 1973 (Almeida et al., 2017). See Section 8.3.2.4.5 for monsoon-related changes. For the tropical Andes region, trends in annual precipitation show heterogenous patterns, ranging between –4% per decade and +4% per decade in the northern and southern tropical Andes for a 30-year period at – the end of the 20th century, although increases during 1965 1984 and decreases since 1984 have been registered in Bolivia (Carmona and Poveda, 2014; Pabón-Caicedo et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_8_11,8,28,"Snowfall is an important component of precipitation in high-latitude and mountain watersheds. Reanalysis data INDICate significant reductions in annual mean potential snowfall areas over NH land by 0.52 million km 2 per decade, with the largest decline over the Alps, with snow water equivalent reductions of about 20 mm per decade (Tamang et al., 2020). In the Tibetan Plateau, region-wide winter snowfall has increased but summer snowfall has decreased during – the 1960 2014 period (Deng et al., 2017). State-of-the-art model simulations INDICate reduced mean annual snowfall in the Arctic, despite the strong precipitation increase, mainly in summer and autum, when temperatures are close to the melting point (Bintanja and Andry, 2017)."
AR6_WG1_8_12,8,30,"Since AR5, the predominant contribution of transpiration to the observed trends in terrestrial evapotranspiration has been revisited and confirmed (Good et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2017). Using satellite and ecosystem models, Zhu et al. (2016) found a positive trend in – leaf area INDEX during 1982 2009, INDICating that greening could contribute to the observed positive trend of evapotranspiration, in line with similar studies that focused on the 1981–2012 (Y. Zhang et al., 2016) and 1982–2013 (K. Zhang et al., 2015) periods. Zeng et al. (2018) determined that the 8% global increase in satellite- observed leaf area INDEX between the 1980s and the 2010s may explain an increase in evapotranspiration of 12.0 ± 2.4 mm yr –1 (about 55 ± 25% of the total observed increase). Forzieri et al. (2020) estimated that the recent increase in leaf area INDEX led to 3.66 ± 0.45 W m –2 in latent heat flux (about 51 ± 6 mm yr –1 ) and that the sensitivity of energy fluxes to leaf area INDEX increased by about 20% over the 1982–2016 period. Overall, there is medium confidence that greening has contributed to the global increase in evapotranspiration since the 1980s."
AR6_WG1_8_13,8,32,"The AR5 reported low confidence in the assessment of trends in global river discharge during the 20th century. This is because many streamflow observations have been impacted by land use and dam construction, and the largest river basins worldwide differ in many characteristics, including geography and morphology. In regions with seasonal snow storage, AR5 WGII assessed that there is robust evidence and high agreement that warming has led to earlier spring discharge maxima and robust evidence of earlier breakup of Arctic river ice, as well as INDICations that warming has led to increased winter flows and decreased summer flows where streamflows are lower and that the observed increases in extreme precipitation led to greater probability of flooding at regional scales with medium confidence. The SROCC found robust evidence and high agreement that discharge due to melting glaciers has already reached its maximum point and has begun declining with smaller glaciers, but only low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has already affected the frequency and magnitude of floods at the global scale."
AR6_WG1_8_14,8,33,"accounted for 8–27% of these soil moisture deficits. Robeson (2015) estimated that the California drought was a 1-in-10,000 year event. Tree ring reconstructions INDICate that prolonged megadroughts have occurred in the western USA throughout the last 1200 years (Cook et al., 2004, 2010; B.I. Cook et al., 2015), forced by internal variability (Coats et al., 2016; Cook et al., 2016b). However, Williams et al. (2020) determined that 2000–2018 drought across the south- western USA was the second driest 19-year period since 800 CE, and attributed nearly half the magnitude of this event to anthropogenic forcing (see also Section 10.4.2.3). Evidence for human signals in drought can also be found in western North American streamflow records, as noted above in Section 8.3.1.5. There is high confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to recent droughts and drying trends in western North America."
AR6_WG1_8_15,8,33,"The Mediterranean region has experienced notable changes in drought and aridity. A number of studies have identified a decline in precipitation since 1960 and attributed this to anthropogenic forcing (Hoerling et al., 2012; Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016; Knutson and Zeng, 2018; Seager et al., 2019b). Kelley et al. (2015) showed that climate change caused a three-fold increase in the likelihood of the 2007–2010 meteorological drought in the eastern Mediterranean. However, historical trends in precipitation across the Mediterranean are spatially variable and contain substantial decadal variability, such that an anthropogenic influence may not be detectable in all areas (Zittis, 2018; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2021). Records of soil moisture provide a clearer signal, INDICating that higher temperatures and increased atmospheric demand have played a strong role in driving Mediterranean aridity (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2014). Hydrological modeling suggests that the recent decline in soil moisture in the Mediterranean is unprecedented in the last 250 years (Hanel et al., 2018). Paleoclimate evidence extends this view, additionally INDICating that dryness in the Mediterranean is approaching an extreme condition compared to the last millennium (Markonis et al., 2018) and that the 15-year drought in the Levant (1998–2012) has an 89% likelihood of being the driest of the last 900 years (Cook et al., 2016a). Marvel et al. (2019) found that the Mediterranean region contributes strongly to the anthropogenic warming component of the global trend in aridity. There is high confidence that anthropogenic forcings are causing increased aridity and drought severity in the Mediterranean region."
AR6_WG1_8_16,8,35,"In south-eastern Australia, the average length of droughts have increased significantly, lasting between 10 and 69% longer than droughts during the first half of the 20th century (Gallant et al., 2013).

AR6_WG1_8_17,8,38,"Observed changes in large-scale circulation INDICATORs (Cross-Chapter Box 2.2) are assessed in Chapters 2 and 3 (Sections 2.3.1.4 and 3.3.3). In this chaper we focus on the influence of regional scale teleconnection variabililty on the water cycle and the attribution of these circulation changes. While observed changes in modes of variability are assessed in Chapters 2 and 4 (Sections 2.4 and 4.3.3), here focus on hydrological teleconnections of relevance to the water cycle."
AR6_WG1_8_18,8,39,"The AR5 concluded it is likely that the tropical belt, as delimited by the Hadley circulation, has widened since the 1970s. Observations in the satellite era INDICate precipitation increases in the core of the Pacific Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and decreases on the ITCZ margins (Gu et al., 2016; Su et al., 2017). As the satellite period has lengthened, observations have increasingly been used to assess trends in the ITCZ and tropical rain belt. Since AR5, significant narrowing and strengthening of the Pacific ITCZ after 1979 have been identified in atmospheric reanalyses (Wodzicki and Rapp, 2016), but no change in the ITCZ location (Byrne et al., 2018). Atmospheric model simulations suggest that with a narrower ITCZ, the subtropical jet becomes baroclinically unstable at a lower latitude and allows mid-latitude eddies to propagate farther equatorward (Watt-Meyer and Frierson, 2019). Observational analyses also show that the ITCZ narrowing (Zhou et al., 2020) is associated with increased precipitation in the ITCZ core region that is strongly coupled to increasing Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) in the expanding dry zones, particularly over land regions in the subtropics and mid- latitudes (Lau and Tao, 2020). In addition, an eastward movement of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) between 1977 and 1999 has been reported, with associated significant precipitation trends in the South Pacific regions (Salinger et al., 2014)."
AR6_WG1_8_19,8,42,"A significant decline in summer monsoon precipitation is observed over India since the mid-20th century, which is accompanied by a weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation (Mishra et al., 2012; Abish et al., 2013; Krishnan et al., 2013, 2016; Saha et al., 2014; Roxy et al., 2015; Guhathakurta et al., 2017; Samanta et al., 2020). This precipitation decline is corroborated by a decreasing trend in the frequency of monsoon depressions that form over Bay of Bengal (Prajeesh et al., 2013; Vishnu et al., 2016), an increasing trend in the frequency and duration of monsoon breaks or ‘dry spells’ (Singh et al., 2014), significant decreases in soil moisture and increases in drought severity across different parts of India post-1950 (Niranjan Kumar et al., 2013; Ramarao et al., 2015, 2019; Krishnan et al., 2016; Ganeshi et al., 2020; Mujumdar et al., 2020). While recent studies have reported an apparent recovery of the Indian summer monsoon over a relatively short period since 2003 (Jin and Wang, 2017; Hari – et al., 2020), long-term trends for the period 1951 2015 INDICate an overall decrease in the regional monsoon precipitation (Kulkarni et al., 2020; Ayantika et al., 2021). A case study on the Indian summer monsoon is provided in Section 10.6.3."
AR6_WG1_8_20,8,42,"Evidence from several climate modelling studies INDICates that the observed decrease in the regional monsoon precipitation during the second half of the 20th century is dominated by the radiative effects of NH anthropogenic aerosols, with smaller contributions due to volcanic aerosols from the Mount Pinatubo (1991) and El Chichón (1982) eruptions (Bollasina et al., 2011; Polson et al., 2014; Sanap et al., 2015; Krishnan et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Lau and Kim, 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Takahashi et al., 2018; Undorf et al., 2018a, b; Patil et al., 2019; M. Singh et al., 2020; see Box 8.1, Figure 1 and Figure 8.11). Land-use changes over South and South East Asia and the rapid warming trend of the equatorial Indian Ocean during the recent few decades also appear to have contributed to the observed decrease in monsoon precipitation (Roxy et al., 2015; Krishnan et al., 2016; Singh, 2016). Overall, the magnitude of the precipitation response to anthropogenic forcing exhibits large spread across CMIP5 models pointing to the strong internal variability of the regional monsoon (Saha et al., 2014; Salzmann et al., 2014; Sinha et al., 2015), including variations linked to phase changes of the Pacific Decadal Variability (Section AVI.2.6; X. Huang et al., 2020a), uncertainties in – representing aerosol cloud interactions (Takahashi et al., 2018), and the effects of local compared with remote aerosol forcing (Bollasina et al., 2014; Polson et al., 2014; Undorf et al., 2018b). CMIP3 and CMIP5 models do not accurately reproduce the observed seasonal cycle of precipitation over the major river basins of South and South East Asia, limiting the attribution of observed regional hydroclimatic changes (Hasson et al., 2014, 2016; Biasutti, 2019). While warm rain processes and organized convection are known to dominate the heavy orographic monsoon rainfall over the Western Ghats mountains (Shige et al., 2017; Choudhury et al., 2018), in various parts of India (Konwar et al., 2012) and East Asia (Section 11.7.3.1), there are uncertainties in representing the regional physical processes – of the monsoon environment, including cloud aerosol interactions – (Sarangi et al., 2017), land atmosphere (e.g., Barton et al., 2020) and – ocean atmosphere coupling (Annamalai et al., 2017), in state-of- the-art climate models (see also Section 8.5.1)."
AR6_WG1_8_21,8,42,"In summary, there is high confidence in observational evidence for a weakening of the SAsiaM in the second half of the 20th century. Results from climate models INDICate that anthropogenic aerosol forcing has dominated the recent decrease in summer monsoon precipitation, as opposed to the expected intensification due to GHG forcing (high confidence). On paleoclimate time scales, the SAsiaM strengthened in response to enhanced summer warming in the NH during the early-to-mid Holocene, while it weakened during cold intervals (high confidence). These changes are tightly linked to orbital forcing and changes in high-latitude climate (medium confidence)."

Since AR5, there has been improved understanding of changes in the EAsiaM, based on paleoclimatic evidence, instrumental observations and climate modeling simulations. Rainfall reconstructions from the Loess Plateau in China INDICate that the northern extent of the monsoon rain belts migrated at least 300 km to the north-west from the LGM to the mid-Holocene (Yang et al., 2015). Similarly, Pliocene"
AR6_WG1_8_23,8,43,"reconstructions INDICate stronger intensity of the EAsiaM with a more northward penetration of the monsoon rain belt (S. Yang et al., 2018a).

The southward shift and enhancement of the jet stream explains the increase of rainfall especially from the Meiyu front (Day et al., 2018) at the expense of drying over north- east China."

AR6_WG1_8_29,8,45,"Since AR5, there has been improved understanding of changes in the South American monsoon (SAmerM) as evidenced from paleoclimate records, instrumental observations and climate model simulations. However, general circulation models (GCMs) still exhibit difficulties in reproducing SAmerM precipitation amount (Rojas et al., 2016; D’Agostino et al., 2020b). Paleoclimate evidence suggests a relatively stronger SAmerM during the 1400–1600 period (Bird et al., 2011b; Vuille et al., 2012; Ledru et al., 2013; Apaéstegui et al., 2014; Novello et al., 2016; Wortham et al., 2017). Last millennium GCM simulations are able to reproduce stronger SAmerM during the 1400–1600 period in comparison with warmer epochs such as the 900–1100 period (Rojas et al., 2016) or the current warming period (Díaz and Vera, 2018). PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations INDICate a consistent weaker SAmerM during the mid-Holocene (6000 years ago; see Cross- Chapter Box 2.1) in comparison to current conditions (Bird et al., 2011a; Mollier-Vogel et al., 2013; Prado et al., 2013a; D’Agostino et al., 2020b), thus favouring savannah/grassland-like vegetation (Smith and Mayle, 2018), in agreement with climate reconstructions from different proxies (Prado et al., 2013b). Signals of weak and strong SAmerM during mid-Holocene and LGM, respectively, are evident also in high-resolution long-term (i.e., more than about 22,000 years) rainfall reconstructions based on oxygen isotopes in speleothems from Brazil (Novello et al., 2017; Stríkis et al., 2018; Campos et al., 2019)."

AR6_WG1_8_31,8,45,"Significant increases in precipitation have been observed over – south-eastern Brazil during 1902 2005 while non-significant decreases have been found over central Brazil (Vera and Díaz, – 2015). In Bolivia, increases were observed during 1965 1984, while reductions have occurred since then (Seiler et al., 2013). However, the Peruvian Amazon does not reveal significant changes in mean rainfall during 1965–2007 (Lavado et al., 2013; Ronchail et al., 2018). Historical simulations from CMIP5 ensembles adequately capture the observed summer precipitation amount over central and south- eastern Brazil, thereby providing high confidence in interpreting the – observed variability of SAmerM for the period 1960 1999 (Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015; Pascale et al., 2019). Also, CMIP5 simulations INDICate that the anthropogenic forcing associated with increased GHG emissions is necessary to explain the positive trends in upper- troposphere zonal winds observed over the South American Altiplano (Vera et al., 2019). However, the detection of anthropogenically- induced signals for precipitation is still ambiguous in monsoon regions, like the SAmerM (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_8_32,8,45,"Since AR5, several studies have examined observed variability and changes in the Australian and Maritime Continent monsoon (AusMCM) using paleoclimate records, instrumental observations and modeling studies (Denniston et al., 2016; Zhang and Moise, 2016). Paleoclimate reconstructions and modelling INDICate that the Indo–Australian monsoon may vary in or out of phase with the EAsiaM, depending on whether there is a meridional displacement or expansion of the tropical rainfall belt (Ayliffe et al., 2013; Denniston et al., 2016). For instance, mid-Holocene simulations suggest that the AusMCM weakens and contracts due to a decreased net energy input and a weaker dynamic component (D’Agostino et al., 2020b)."
AR6_WG1_8_33,8,46,"The Maritime Continent (MC) experiences the influence of both the Asian and the Australian monsoons, with rainfall peaking during boreal winter/austral summer (Robertson et al., 2011). Reductions in land rainfall and marine cloudiness over the MC and weakening of surface moisture flux convergence have been observed in the period – 1950 1999 (Tokinaga et al., 2012; Yoden et al., 2017). These trends are INDICative of a slowdown of the Walker Circulation, with positive sea level pressure trends over the MC and negative trends over the central equatorial Pacific (Tokinaga et al., 2012). More recently – (1981 2014), a trend of increasing annual rainfall over large areas of the MC has been identified (Hassim and Timbal, 2019). Given the large variability in MC rainfall on interannual time scales, the choice of time period may influence the calculated rainfall trend (Hassim and Timbal, 2019). –"
AR6_WG1_8_34,8,46,"In addition to evidence that rain-rates have increased, there is evidence that TC translation speed has slowed globally (Kossin, 2018) thus amplifying thermodynamic intensification of rainfall and may be linked to anthropogenic forcing (Gutmann et al., 2018). This is limited evidence however, so there is medium confidence of a detectable change in TC translation speed over the US. Since the 1900s, and there is low confidence for a global signal because of limited agreement among models and due to data heterogeneity. However, the slowdown is consistent with theoretical and modelling studies that INDICate a general weakening of the tropical circulation with warming that reduces the speed of the TC system (Chauvin et al., 2017), though there is limited observational evidence (Sections 8.2.3.5 and 11.7.1)."
AR6_WG1_8_35,8,47,"In contrast, it has been shown that observed trends in blocking are sensitive the choice of the blocking INDEX, and that there is a large internal variability that complicates the detection of forced trends (Barnes et al., 2014; Cattiaux et al., 2016; Woollings et al., 2018), compromising the attribution of any observed changes in blocking. Many climate models still underestimate the occurrence of blocking, at least in winter over north-eastern Atlantic and Europe (Dunn- Sigouin and Son, 2013), which leads to caution in the interpretation of their results for these regions. However, over the Pacific Ocean there have been large improvements in the simulation of blocking for the last 20 years (Davini and D’Andrea, 2016; Patterson et al., 2019). In the SH, increases in blocking frequency have occurred in the South Atlantic in austral summer (Dennison et al., 2016) and in the southern Indian Ocean in austral spring (Schemm, 2018). A reduced blocking frequency has been found over the south-western Pacific in austral spring (Sections 2.3.1.4.3 and 3.4.1.3.3; Schemm, 2018)."
AR6_WG1_8_36,8,47,"The AR5 INDICated low confidence in long-term changes in the intensity of extratropical cyclones (ETC) over the 20th century derived from centennial reanalyses and storminess proxies based upon sea level pressure. This was confirmed by the SREX assessment that the main Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical storm tracks likely experienced a poleward shift during the last 50 years (Seneviratne et al., 2012) with low confidence, and inconsistencies within reanalysis datasets remain."
AR6_WG1_8_37,8,53,"Over global land there is a small range in global mean multi- model mean precipitation increase across scenarios in the mid- – – term (2.6 4.0 %), which widens (to 2.6 8.8 %) in the long-term (Table 8.1). The long-term projections are consistent with the Chapter 4 assessment that global annual precipitation over land is – projected to increase on average by 2.4 [ 0.2 to +4.7] % (likely range) in the SSP1-1.9 low-emissions scenario and by 8.3 [0.9 to 12.9] % in the SSP5-8.5 high emissions scenario by 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014. Small differences in assessed model mean changes in Chapter 4, Table 4.2 result from a slightly different set of models – considered for Table 8.1. Over land, P–E increases by around 2 3% in the mid-term (apart from SSP5-8.5 where increases are almost – 5%) and around 1 12% in the long-term, determined by increased moisture transport from the ocean to land (Section 8.4.1.2). Runoff increases are larger and less certain due to additional inputs from glacier melt and changes in groundwater storage (Section 8.4.1.7). Overall, precipitation and runoff are very likely to increase over the global land in all scenarios in the mid- and long term. P–E is likely to increase over global land in the mid- and long term and very likely in SSP1-1.9, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 pathways. The mid-term consistency in projections across scenarios is not apparent for precipitable water – vapour, which increases over land by around 6 15% in the mid-term – and 5 36% in the long-term across all scenarios. This implies that increases in extreme precipitation (closely related to atmospheric water vapour content; Section 8.2.3.2) are dependent on mitigation pathway, even in the mid-term (Section 11.4.5). Water vapour residence time (computed as the ratio of precipitable water vapour to precipitation from values in Table 8.1) increases from eight days in the present to nine days in mid-term and up to about ten days in the long-term over land in SSP3-7.0, INDICating a longer time to moisten the atmosphere between precipitation events. The CMIP6 projections are therefore consistent with an intensification but not acceleration of the global water cycle."
AR6_WG1_8_38,8,56,"The AR5 identified that high-latitude precipitation increase may lead to an increase in snowfall in the coldest regions and a decrease of snowfall in warmer regions due to a decreased number of freezing days. The fraction of precipitation falling as snow and the duration of snow cover was projected to decrease. Heavy snowfall events globally are not expected to decrease significantly with warming as they occur close to the water freezing point, which will migrate poleward and in altitude (O’Gorman, 2014; Turner et al., 2019). There are only a small number of studies evaluating the implications of this mechanism in specific regions. A study for the north-eastern USA INDICates smaller reductions for major snowfall events against the broader decline in snowfall expected from thermodynamic effects (Bintanja and Andry, 2017). Arctic snowfall is projected to decrease as rainfall makes up more of the precipitation (Zarzycki, 2018)."
AR6_WG1_8_39,8,59,"In summary, it is virtually certain that global precipitation will increase with warming due to increases in GHG concentrations and decreases in air pollution. There is high confidence that total precipitation will increase in the high latitudes, with a shift from snowfall to rainfall except in the coldest regions and seasons. There is also high confidence that precipitation will decrease over the Mediterranean, southern Africa, Amazonia, Central America, south-western South America, south-western Australia and coastal West Africa and that monsoon precipitation will increase over South Asia, East Asia and central-eastern Sahel. See Section 8.4.2.4 for a more detailed assessment of changes in regional monsoons. Daily mean precipitation intensities, including extremes, are projected to increase over most regions (high confidence). The number of dry days is projected to increase over the subtropics, Amazonia, and Central America (medium confidence).

However, substantial uncertainties in projections of evapotranspiration, especially at seasonal and regional scales, remain (see also Section 8.2.3.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.1)."
AR6_WG1_8_41,8,65,"Although there are regions where multiple models predict consistent and significant changes in soil moisture, as with evapotranspiration (Section 8.4.1.4), there is still uncertainty in these projections related to the response of plants to elevated CO . Most models project increases in two variables that have opposite effects on surface water availability: plant water use efficiency (WUE) and leaf area INDEX (LAI; see Section 8.4.1.4). As discussed in Sections 8.2.3.3, 8.3.1.4 and 8.4.1.4, there is low confidence in how these changes in plant physiology will affect future projections of evapotranspiration, and likewise, drought and aridity."

Drought intensity is projected to increase in the tropics, mainly in the Amazonian basin, Central Africa, and southern Asia, as well as in Central America and south-western South America (Ukkola et al., 2020). The CORDEX South Asia multi-model ensemble projections INDICate an increase in the frequency and severity of droughts over central and northern India during the 21st century, under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (medium confidence) (Mujumdar et al., 2020). Under intermediate or high-emissions scenarios, the likelihood of extreme droughts (events that have magnitudes equal to or less than the 10th percentile of the 1851–1880 baseline period) increases by 200–300% in the Amazonian basin, south-western North America, Central America, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and south- western South America (Cook et al., 2020). Even under a low- emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6), the likelihood of extreme droughts increases by 100% in south-western North America, south-western South America, the Amazon, the Mediterranean, and southern Africa (Cook et al., 2020). Thus, there is high confidence that drought severity and intensity will increase in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, south-western South America, south-western North America, south-western Australia, Central America and the Amazonian basin."
AR6_WG1_8_43,8,66,"Paleoclimate records provide context for these future expected changes in drought and aridity. In the Mediterranean, western North America, and Central Chile, there is high confidence that climate change will shift soil moisture (as represented by the Palmer Drought Severity INDEX) outside the range of observed and reconstructed values spanning the last millennium (Figure 8.20; Cook et al., 2014; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016). Warmer temperatures, leading to increased evaporative losses, are clearly implicated in the projected future drying in these semi-arid regions (Dai et al., 2018), emphasizing the central role that warming plays in driving increased evaporative demand (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020). In contrast, future trajectories are more uncertain in regions like Central Asia and eastern Australia–New Zealand where projected changes in precipitation and soil moisture are less coherent (Figure 8.19 and 8.20; Hessl et al., 2018).

Under a low-emissions scenario (Marzeion et al., 2020) all regions exhibit runoff in the decades prior to 2050. Under a high-emissions scenario however, low- and mid-latitude regions show peak runoff before approximately 2060, – whereas Arctic regions peak in later decades around 2070 2090. Antarctic glacier losses will not have peaked by the end of the century in the high-emissions scenario. Globally, peak runoff of 2.5 to 3 mm yr –1 sea level equivalent occurs around 2090 (Marzeion et al., 2020). Regional projections are presented in detail in Section 9.5.1 and Figure 9.21, and briefly summarized below.

Under mid-range emissions scenarios glaciers in this region are projected to reach peak runoff during the period 2020 to 2040 (Marzeion et al., 2020). Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia: Post-AR5 but pre-SROCC projections INDICated a potential 70 ± 10% reduced volume of glacier ice in western Canada relative to 2005 (Clarke et al., 2015), with few glaciers remaining in the Interior and Rockies regions and maritime glaciers in north-western British Columbia surviving only in a diminished state. Recent global projections support these earlier findings, showing that glacier mass in western Canada and the USA may reduce by 50% under low-emissions scenarios and be completely lost under the highest emissions and most sensitive glacier model combinations (Figure 9.21; Marzeion et al., 2020). Arctic Canada and Alaskan glaciers are projected to experience more modest mass loss (0–60% depending on region, scenario, and model; Marzeion et al., 2020)."

Some studies project substantial decreases (Spencer et al., 2016) while others INDICate possible increases (Schuerch et al., 2018). SRCCL also noted the general expectation for decreases in water resources, including wetlands, in areas of decreased rainfall due to increased evaporation."

Greater warming over the Asian land region compared to the ocean contributes to intensification of the monsoon low-level south-westerly winds and precipitation (Endo et al., 2018), even though the combined effect of upper and lower tropospheric warming makes the Asian monsoon circulation response rather complicated. A high resolution model projection, based on the RCP8.5 scenario, INDICates that a northward shift of the low-level jet and associated weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation can induce a large reduction in the genesis of monsoon low pressure systems by the late 21st century (Sandeep et al., 2018). Experiments with constant forcing INDICate that at 1.5°C and 2°C global warming levels, mean precipitation and monsoon extremes are projected to intensify in summer over India and South Asia (Chevuturi et al., 2018; D. Lee et al., 2018) and that a 0.5°C difference would imply a 3% increase of precipitation (Chevuturi et al., 2018).

AR6_WG1_8_49,8,75,"CMIP5 projections INDICated a possible intensification of the EAsiaM circulation during the 21st century, in addition to precipitation increase, although there is a lack of consensus on changes in the western North Pacific subtropical high, this is an important feature of the EAsiaM circulation (Kitoh, 2017). Furthermore, the EAsiaM precipitation enhancements in the CMIP5 projections are prominent over the southern part of the Baiu rainband by the late 21st century, with no significant changes in the Meiyu precipitation over central- eastern China (Horinouchi et al., 2019). It was also shown that the Baiu precipitation response in CMIP5 projections is accompanied by a southward retreat of the western North Pacific subtropical high and a southward shift of the East Asian subtropical jet (Horinouchi et al., 2019). According to the high-resolution MRI-AGCM global warming experiments, future summer precipitation could potentially increase on the southern side and decrease on the northern side of the present- day Baiu location in response to downward-motion tendencies which can offset the ‘wet-gets-wetter’ effect, but is subject to large model uncertainties (Ose, 2019). Future projections of land warming over – the Eurasian continent (Endo et al., 2018) and intensified land sea thermal contrast (Z. Wang et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2019) can potentially intensify the EAsiaM circulation during the 21st century. However, there are large uncertainties in projected water cycle changes over the region (Endo et al., 2018), mostly in the near-term because of uncertainties in future aerosol emissions scenarios (Wilcox et al., 2020), as well as due to the interplay between internal variability and anthropogenic external forcing (Wang et al., 2021)."

In contrast, other studies INDICate projected earlier onsets and delayed retreats of the SAmerM under the RCP8.5 scenario based on six CMIP5 models (Jones and Carvalho, 2013). These differences have been linked to the methodology used to determine monsoon timing, and sensitivity to the monsoon domain considered (Section 8.3.2.4.5; Correa et al., 2021). Recent studies provide further evidence for the projection of delayed SAmerM onsets by the late 21st century (Sena and Magnusdottir, 2020). An analysis of six CMIP6 models under the SSP5-8.5 scenario confirm the projections of delayed SAmerM onsets by the end of the 21st century (Moon and Ha, 2020). In addition, projected changes in the intensity and length of the SAmerM season have been found to be model-dependent (Pascale et al., 2019).

Further analysis using 15 different CMIP6 models for the SSP2-4.5 scenario suggest reductions in total SAmerM rainfall (B. Wang et al., 2020). However, other analyses of CMIP6 projections under different SSP scenarios do not report clear changes in the SAmerM precipitation throughout the 21st century (Figure 8.22; Z. Chen et al., 2020b; Jin et al., 2020). Similar uncertainties for all the SSP scenarios used across the report are found for other water cycle variables, including runoff and P–E (Table 8.2). Furthermore, there is disagreement in projected extreme precipitation in the region, with some CMIP5-based studies suggest reductions (Marengo et al., 2014), while others INDICate increases based on CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (Kitoh et al., 2013; Sena and Magnusdottir, 2020)."
AR6_WG1_8_53,8,77,"The northern and eastern parts of the Maritime Continent have projected increases in rainfall in CMIP5 models (Siew et al., 2014), while there are projected decreases over Java, Sulawesi and southern parts of Borneo and Sumatra. Rainfall changes are correlated with the extent of warming in the western tropical Pacific in CMIP5 models (Brown et al., 2016b) but inter-model differences are also related to modelled large-scale zonal mean precipitation response in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 model ensembles (Narsey et al., 2020). Decomposition of projected rainfall changes INDICates that the largest source of model uncertainty is associated with shifts in the spatial pattern of convection (Chadwick et al., 2013; Brown et al., 2016b). Uncertainties in capturing the spatial and temporal features of the Maritime Continent monsoon depend also on the horizontal resolution of coupled climate models (e.g., Jourdain et al., 2013)."

There is also a projected increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall but a reduction in the frequency of heavy rainfall days for the Australian monsoon (Dey et al., 2019a).

However, rainfall variability related to ENSO is projected to increase significantly by the second half of the 21st century, regardless of ENSO amplitude (Section 4.5.3.2). Regional precipitation variability associated with ENSO increases due to increases in atmospheric moisture, regardless of changes in ENSO variability itself (Pendergrass et al., 2017). In many regions, the magnitude of the projected changes related to ENSO is small compared with historical interannual variability (Bonfils et al., 2015; Power and Delage, 2018; Perry et al., 2020). Uncertainties in precipitation projections related to ENSO depend on internal variability associated with the mode (Section 8.5.2), hence the need to have relatively large ensembles (about 15 members) to adequately estimate uncertainty (Deser et al., 2018; N.

Inconsistent changes in the ENSO–Indian summer monsoon relationship in response to global warming in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models may be related to statistical issues rather than dynamical changes (Bódai et al., 2020; Haszpra et al., 2020).

AR6_WG1_8_60,8,83,"The AR5 Chapter 7 recognized that the simulation of clouds and precipitation remains challenging for state-of-the-art GCMs. Model development and evaluation have continued since AR5, with a particular emphasis on the representation of new model components, like interactive vegetation, aerosols and biogeochemical cycles. For example, the comparison of simulated tropical precipitation across three successive generations of CMIP models (including CMIP6) INDICates overall little improvement for the summer monsoons, the double-ITCZ bias, the diurnal cycle and the frequency of precipitation (Fiedler et al., 2020). Some of these issues are related to inherent model limitations in three specific areas: – atmospheric convection, cloud aerosol interactions and land surface processes (ocean and cryosphere-related processes are addressed in Chapter 9). These limitations do not weaken the overall progress made in the large-scale simulation of present-day climate (FAQ 3.3 and Section 3.3.2.3), even though the improvement of CMIP6 compared with CMIP5 models is limited (Figure 3.12) and is generally less systematic or obvious at the regional scale (e.g., Gusain et al., 2020; Monerie et al., 2020; Oudar et al., 2020a). Instead, they call for a careful interpretation of hydrological projections with the full range of plausible outcomes, rather than only considering the most likely scenarios (Sutton, 2018, 2019)."
AR6_WG1_8_61,8,87,"Recent studies based on both GCMs and CPMs INDICate that both CAPE and convective inhibition will increase in a warmer climate (Section 8.2.3.2; J. Chen et al., 2020a), consistent with a shift from moderate to less frequent but stronger convective events (Rasmussen et al., 2020). If underestimated by models with parametrized convection, such a mechanism could explain the underestimation of both projected increase in precipitation extremes (Borodina et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2018) and land surface drying (Douville and Plazzotta, 2017) in the extratropics.

It is unclear whether remaining discrepancies represent limitations of the climate models, or limitations of the proxy system models. Therefore, there is medium to high confidence (i.e., depending on the region) that climate models do not underestimate water cycle internal variability. The mechanisms driving internal variability in the water cycle in climate model simulations varies. While models INDICate that cool SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific (La Niña or the cool phase of the PDO) are associated with drought in south-western North America, they also show that atmospheric internal variability may be a more prominent driver (Coats et al., 2015, 2016; Stevenson et al., 2015; Parsons et al., 2018).

AR6_WG1_8_63,8,89,"Since AR5, SMILEs have helped quantify the time of emergence of climate change signals (see Sections 1.4.2.2 and 10.4.3). Results from SMILEs INDICate that by 2000–2009 (compared to 1950–1999), simulated anthropogenic shifts in mean annual precipitation already emerged over 36–41% of the globe including high latitudes (Frankcombe et al., 2018; Kumar and Ganguly, 2018), the eastern subtropical oceans, and the tropics (Zhang and Delworth, 2018). By 2050 (2100), more than 60% (85%) of the globe is projected to show detectable anthropogenic shifts in mean annual precipitation (Zhang and Delworth, 2018). Other SMILE results for the 1950–2100 period (Kay et al., 2015; Sigmond and Fyfe, 2016) INDICate that internal variability can obscure the detection of the anthropogenic hydroclimatic signal until the middle to late 21st century in many parts of the world for both mean and extreme precipitation (Martel et al., 2018; Dai and Bloecker, 2019).

Attempts to include volcanic forcing in future projections show enhanced precipitation variability on annual to decadal time scales with small reductions in Asian monsoon rainfall (Bethke et al., 2017). The occurrence of volcanic eruptions in the coming century, either as single large events or clustered smaller ones, can alter the water cycle (see also Cross-Chapter Box 4.1), and regional drought events may be enhanced by co-occurring volcanic (Liu et al., 2016; Gao and Gao, 2017; Zambri et al., 2017) and GHG (e.g., Cook et al., 2018) forcing (low confidence).

Thus there is strong potential for dust to contribute to abrupt changes in the water cycle, especially in semi-arid regions where wind erosion is highly sensitive to vegetation cover and drought variability (Yu et al., 2015). One such event occurred over the Central USA during the 1930s: the Dust Bowl drought, an iconic event characterized by widespread land degradation and historically unprecedented levels of dust storm activity (Hansen and Libecap, 2004; Lee and Gill, 2015). While initialized by warm sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, modeling work INDICates that land cover changes and resulting dust emissions contributed to the severity and spatial extent of the drought by further suppressing precipitation (Cook et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2018; Cowan et al., 2020). There is also increasing evidence that dust aerosol feedbacks are necessary to explain the magnitude of rainfall increase during the mid-Holocene Green Sahara (Pausata et al., 2016; Tierney et al., 2017)."

The Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) did not assess past SST change. Since AR5, improvements in the understanding of recent SST biases in the observational records, especially extending ship-based observations variations may be indirectly affected by anthropogenic influences. as understanding can vary from low confidence in groundwater changes (Sections 8.2.3 and 8.3.1.7). sea level relative to the geoid and is associated with the circulation level change varies regionally but by definition has a zero global pressure.

The AR5 assessment is confirmed, and it is now very likely that global mean SST changed by 0.88 [0.68 to 1.01] °C from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020, and 0.60 [0.44 to 0.74] °C from 1980 to 2020 (Figure 9.3 and Table 2.4)."
AR6_WG1_9_2,9,13,"It is virtually certain that SST will continue to increase in the 21st century, at a rate depending on future emissions scenarios. The future global mean SST increase projected by CMIP6 models for the period 1995–2014 to 2081–2100 is 0.86 [5–95% range: 0.43–1.47] °C under SSP1‑2.6, 1.51 [1.02 to 2.19] °C under SSP2‑4.5, 2.19 [1.56 to 3.30] °C under SSP3‑7.0, and 2.89 [2.01 to 4.07] °C under SSP5‑8.5 (Figure 9.3). While under SSP1‑2.6, the CMIP6 ensemble consistently projects that it is very likely at least 83% of the world ocean surface will have warmed by 2100, and under SSP5‑8.5, at least 98% of the world ocean surface will have warmed. The spatial pattern of future change is consistent with observed SST change over the 20th century, though with notable regional differences (Figure 9.3). Long-term change in SST patterns is important for regional impacts but also affects radiative feedbacks, and therefore long-term change in climate sensitivity (Section 7.4.4.3). In the Southern Ocean, CMIP6 models project that SSTs will eventually consistently increase in the 21st century, at a rate dependent on future scenarios (Figure 9.3 and Section 9.2.3.2; Bracegirdle et al., 2020). Yet, there is only low confidence that this Southern Ocean warming will emerge by the end of the century (Section 7.4.4.1), due to the inconsistent historical and near-term simulations and observations over the 20th century (Figure 9.3). Furthermore, the equilibrium SST pattern from proxy records or simulated by climate models under CO forcing stand in contrast with the cooling trends in the Southern Ocean observed over the past decades (Section 7.4.4.1.2). Similarly, the SST change pattern observed in the tropical Pacific Ocean will transition on centennial time scales to a mean pattern resembling the El Niño pattern (medium confidence) (Annex IV). However, it is difficult to delineate a climate change trend ressembling an El Niño pattern and El Niño variability (Wittenberg, 2009; Collins et al., 2010) without large ensembles (Kay et al., 2015). Several Pliocene SST reconstructions INDICate enhanced warming in the centre of the eastern Pacific equatorial cold tongue upwelling region, consistent with reconstruction of enhanced subsurface warming and enhanced warming in coastal upwelling regions (Section 7.4.4.2.2). The North Atlantic subpolar gyre is projected to continue to warm more slowly than surrounding regions (Suo et al., 2017), as the Gulf Stream concurrently warms rapidly (Figure 9.3; Cheng et al., 2013) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation further declines under greenhouse gas forcing, although models disagree about the rate of change (Figure 9.3 and Section 9.2.3.1). In summary, CMIP6 models show a future pattern of SST change comparable to historical trends with intensity depending"
AR6_WG1_9_3,9,22,"CMIP5 and CMIP6 models simulate OHC changes that are consistent with the updated observational and improved estimates of OHC over the period 1960 to 2018 (Figures 9.6, 9.7 and 9.8), and they replicate the vertical partitioning of OHC change for the industrial era, although with a tendency to underestimate OHC gain shallower than 2000 m and overestimate it deeper than 2000 m (Section 3.5.1.3). The AR5 (Flato et al., 2013) assessed that climate models transport heat downward more than the real ocean. Since AR5, studies have shown that increasing the horizontal resolution of ocean models tends to increase agreement of vertical heat transport with observations as the dependency on ad-hoc choices of eddy parametrizations is relaxed (Griffies et al., 2015; Chassignet et al., 2020). The magnitude of the AMOC and Indonesian Throughflow affect future OHC change – for example, through overestimated modelled downward heat pumping (Kostov et al., 2014) – and there are INDICations of greater model consistency in these transports at higher resolution (Figure 9.10; Chassignet et al., 2020; L.C. Jackson et al., 2020). Climate models tend to reproduce the observed added heat, but redistributed heat is less well represented (Figure 9.8; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020; Dias et al., 2020; Couldrey et al., 2021). Since redistributed heat dominates historical OHC change, historical simulations poorly reproduce regional patterns, but as future OHC change will become dominated by added heat, more skill in future modelled OHC patterns is expected (Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). In summary, climate models have more skill in representing OHC change from added heat than from ocean circulation change (high confidence). Since added heat dominates over redistributed heat on a centennial scale (especially under high-emissions scenarios) confidence in future modelled OHC patterns at the end of the 21st century is greater than at decadal scale."
AR6_WG1_9_4,9,24,"The AR5 (Rhein et al., 2013) assessed that it was very likely that subsurface salinity changes reflect surface salinity change, and that basin-scale regions of high salinity and evaporation had trended more saline, while regions of low salinity and more precipitation had trended fresher since the 1950s. The SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) assessment was consistent with AR5. Section 2.3.3.2 strengthens evidence that subsurface salinity trends are connected to surface trends (very likely), which are, in turn, linked to an intensifying hydrological cycle (medium confidence). Increasing evidence from updated observational records INDICates that it is now virtually certain that surface salinity contrasts are increasing. At basin scale, Section 2.3.3.2 and AR5 concur that it is very likely that the Pacific and Southern Ocean have freshened, and the Atlantic has become more saline. Figures 3.25 and 3.27 compare CMIP6 models to salinity observations."
AR6_WG1_9_5,9,27,"The SROCC (Collins et al., 2019) assessed that in situ observations (2004–2017) and sea surface temperature reconstructions INDICate that AMOC has weakened relative to 1850–1900 (medium confidence). However, SROCC also assessed that there is insufficient data to quantify the magnitude of the weakening, or to properly attribute it to anthropogenic forcing, due to the limited length of the observational record. Here, this assessment is adjusted to low confidence in the weakening (as also discussed in Sections 2.3.3.4.1 and 3.5.4.1). The CMIP5 multi-model mean showed no 20th century trend in AMOC (Cheng et al., 2013). The CMIP6 multi-model mean slightly opposes the reconstructed decline due to a strong increase in the 1940–1985 period (Menary et al., 2020b; Weijer et al., 2020), thought to be in response to aerosol forcing (Section 3.5.4.1), followed by a smaller decline since the 1990s. Also, agreement between different proxy-based reconstructions is weak in many details (Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019) and questions can be raised regarding various proxies used in reconstructions (Section 2.3.3.4.1). For instance, SST-based proxies can be influenced by atmospheric and other processes acting on different time scales (Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019; Jackson and Wood, 2020). In addition, many proxies are indirect and based on AMOC-related processes assumed to be similar to those found in models, such as the link between AMOC and Labrador Sea convection, which has been questioned recently (see above). In addition, the subpolar gyre from which many AMOC proxies are taken may vary independently of AMOC, with similar patterns in SST and OHC driven by wind variability (Williams et al., 2014; Piecuch et al., 2017). Finally, a new dynamic reconstruction of the Atlantic inflow to the Nordic Seas suggests no slowdown over the past 70 to 100 years (Rossby et al., 2020), in contrast to a new compilation of proxy reconstructions which suggests that AMOC is presently in its weakest state in the last millennium (Caesar et al., 2021), reinforcing the evidence that motivated the previous SROCC assessment. Section 3.5.4.1 also questions the veracity of the models’ forced AMOC response during the 20th century. Given the large discrepancy between modelled and reconstructed AMOC"
AR6_WG1_9_6,9,32,"Subpolar gyre systems can change abruptly due to a positive feedback between convective mixing and salinity transport (Born et al., 2013, 2016) and air–sea interaction (Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014; Moreno-Chamarro et al., 2017) within the gyre. In the Arctic, both the Beaufort gyre and mesoscale eddies strengthened between 2003 and 2014 (Armitage et al., 2017), which might be partly due to increased wind stress (Oldenburg et al., 2018) or reduced sea ice thickness and changes in sea ice pack morphology (van der Linden et al., 2019). Presently, there is limited evidence in attributing causality to these changes for any of the proposed mechanisms. In the North Pacific, there has been an increasing trend in the Alaska Gyre from 1993 to 2017 (Cummins and Masson, 2018), which might be attributed to Pacific Decadal Oscillation (low confidence) (Hristova et al., 2019). In the Southern Ocean, limited evidence INDICates that the subpolar gyres respond to Southern Hemisphere atmospheric modes of variability at interannual time scale (Armitage et al., 2018; Dotto et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_9_7,9,37,"The North Atlantic sea level change dipole is forced by a reduction in heat loss from the ocean north of 40°N (i.e., net heat uptake), which in all Earth system models leads to a weakening of the AMOC, although the magnitude has a large model spread (Section 9.2.3.1; Gregory et al., 2016; Huber and Zanna, 2017). The reduced northward transport of warm, salty water (Section 9.2.2) causes further ocean dynamic sea level change, whose details are model-dependent. North of 40°N, this redistribution leads to a sea level rise, predominantly halosteric, reinforcing the thermosteric effect of heat uptake (Couldrey et al., 2021). Comparison of observed Atlantic OHC for 1955–2017 with a reconstruction assuming no change in circulation INDICates that the thermosteric sea level change resulting from southward redistribution of heat may be detectable (Zanna et al., 2019). This redistribution causes a tendency for SST cooling north of 40°N and anomalous heat input from the atmosphere, and thus a positive feedback on AMOC weakening (Winton et al., 2013; Gregory et al., 2016; Todd et al., 2020; Couldrey et al., 2021). Many climate and ocean models agree that the AMOC weakening is associated with"
AR6_WG1_9_8,9,37,"The observed decrease of Arctic sea ice area is a key INDICATOR of large-scale climate change (Section 2.3.2.1.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.2). The SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019) assesses that sea ice extent, which is the total area of all grid cells with at least 15% sea ice concentration, has declined since 1979 in each month of the year (very high confidence). In contrast to SROCC, we assess changes in sea ice area (the actual area of the ocean covered by sea ice) rather than sea ice extent, because sea ice area is geophysically more relevant and not grid-dependent (Notz, 2014; Ivanova et al., 2016; Notz et al., 2016; Notz and SIMIP Community, 2020). Arctic sea ice area is calculated based on measurements by passive microwave satellite sensors that provide near-continuous measurements of gridded, pan-Arctic sea ice concentration from 1979 onwards. Irreducible uncertainties in the conversion of thermal microwave brightness temperature to sea ice concentration, and choices in algorithm design, cause uncertainties in observed Arctic sea ice area, which are far smaller than the observed sea ice loss (e.g., Comiso et al., 2017a; Niederdrenk and Notz, 2018; Alekseeva et al., 2019; Kern et al., 2019; Meier and Stewart, 2019). Sea ice area has decreased in every month of the year from 1979 to the present (very high confidence) (Figure 9.13). The absolute and the relative ice losses are highest in late summer-early autumn (high confidence) (Figure 9.13). Averaged over the decade 2010–2019, the monthly Arctic sea ice area from August to October has been around 2 million km² (or about 25%) smaller than during 1979–1988 (high confidence) (Figure 9.13)."
AR6_WG1_9_9,9,38,"Reconstructions of Arctic sea ice coverage put the satellite period changes into centennial context. Direct observational data coverage (Walsh et al., 2017) and model reconstructions (Brennan et al., 2020) warrant high confidence that the low Arctic sea ice area of summer 2012 is unprecedented since 1850, and that the summer sea ice loss is significant in all Arctic regions except for the Central Arctic (Cai et al., 2021). Direct winter observational data coverage before 1953 is too sparse to reliably assess Arctic sea ice area. Since 1953, the years 2015 to 2018 had the four lowest values of maximum Arctic sea ice area, which usually occurs in March (high confidence) (Figure 2.20). Reconstructions of Arctic sea ice area before 1850 remain sparse, and as in SROCC, there remains medium confidence that the current sea ice levels in late summer are unique during the past 1 kyr (Section 2.3.2.1.1; Kinnard et al., 2011; De Vernal et al., 2013b). and changes, and projected sea-ice metrics in SSP2-4.5 The observed fluctuations and trends of the Arctic sea ice cover arise from a combination of changes in natural external forcing and anthropogenic forcing, internal variability and internal feedbacks (e.g., Notz and Stroeve, 2018; Halloran et al., 2020). New paleo-proxy techniques INDICate regional sea ice changes over epochs and millennia and allow possible drivers to be assessed. Biomarker IP25 (Belt et al., 2007) together with other sedimentary biomarkers (Belt, 2018) provide local temporal information on seasonal sea ice coverage, permanent sea ice coverage and ice-free waters, with occasional ambiguous contrasting results (Belt, 2019). These records and other proposed paleo proxies, including bromine in ice cores (Spolaor et al., 2016), dinocyst assemblages (e.g., De Vernal et al., 2013b) and driftwood (e.g., Funder et al., 2011), provide evidence of sea ice fluctuations that exceed internal variability (high confidence). The inferred sea ice fluctuations over millennia can be related to Northern Hemisphere temperature evolution and give rise to Arctic-wide fluctuations in sea ice coverage in the paleorecord (Section 2.3.2.1.1). On a regional scale, fluctuations include decreased sea ice cover during the Allerød warm period (14.7–12.9 ka) in the Laptev (Hörner et al., 2016) and Bering Seas (Méheust et al., 2018); an extensive sea ice cover during the Younger Dryas (around 12 ka) in the Bering (Méheust et al., 2018), Kara (Hörner et al., 2018), Laptev (Hörner et al., 2016) and Barents (Belt et al., 2015) Seas, and at the Yermak Plateau (Kremer et al., 2018); little sea ice during the early Holocene, when Northern Hemisphere summer insolation was higher than today (8000 to 9000 years before present), in the North Icelandic Shelf area (Cabedo-Sanz et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2017), Sea of Okhotsk (Lo et al., 2018), Canadian Arctic (Spolaor et al., 2016),"
AR6_WG1_9_10,9,40,"practically sea ice free in the September mean for the first time for future CO emissions of less than 1000 Gt and before the year 2050 in all SSP scenarios (Notz and SIMIP Community, 2020). This new assessment is consistent with an observation-based projection of a practically sea ice-free Arctic Ocean in September for additional anthropogenic CO emissions of 800 ± 330 GtCO beyond the year 2018 (Notz and Stroeve, 2018; Stroeve and Notz, 2018). This estimate may, however, be too high due to neglecting possible future reduction in atmospheric aerosol load that would cause additional warming (Gagné et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2018), and is subject to the same constraints as the carbon budget analysis for global mean temperature (see section 5.5 for details). Based on CMIP6 simulations, it is very likely that the Arctic Ocean will remain sea ice covered in winter in all scenarios throughout this century (Sections 4.3.2 and 4.4.2). There is an INDICation that CMIP6 simulations of Arctic sea ice have improved relative to CMIP5 (Section 3.4.1.1), but detailed evaluation studies exist mainly for CMIP5 models. These studies found that CMIP5 model projections and reanalyses show a large spread of simulated regional Arctic sea ice concentration (Laliberté et al., 2016; Chevallier et al., 2017), which remains true for CMIP6 models (Shu et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020). In addition, both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show a large spread in the simulated seasonal cycle of Arctic sea ice area, with too high a sea ice area in March in the ensemble mean (Notz and SIMIP Community, 2020). The CMIP5 models have also had difficulty simulating realistic landfast sea ice (Laliberté et al., 2018). These findings imply that both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models do not realistically capture the regional and seasonal processes governing observed Arctic sea ice evolution, causing low confidence in the models’ projections of future regional sea ice evolution, including updated projections for shipping routes across the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage (Wei et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_9_11,9,43,"The analysis and understanding of the long-term evolution of the Antarctic sea ice cover is hindered by the scarcity of observational records before the satellite period, and the scarcity of paleorecords (see Section 2.3.2.1.2 for further details). Such long records are particularly relevant given that the Southern Ocean response to external forcing takes longer than the length of the available direct observational record (Goosse and Renssen, 2001; Armour et al., 2016). There is only limited evidence for large-scale decadal fluctuations in sea ice coverage caused by large-scale temperature and wind forcing. Sparse direct pre-satellite observations suggest a decrease in sea ice coverage from the 1950s to the 1970s (Fan et al., 2014). Paleo-proxy data INDICate that, on multi-decadal to multi-centennial time scales, sea ice coverage of the Southern Ocean follows large-scale temperature trends (e.g., Crosta et al., 2018; Chadwick et al., 2020; Lamping et al., 2020), for example linked to fluctuations in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode (Crosta et al., 2021), and that during the Last Glacial Maximum, Antarctic sea ice extended to about the polar front latitude in most regions during winter, whereas the extent during summer is less well understood (e.g., Benz et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2016; Nair et al., 2019)."

Although surface melt is anticorrelated with the summer North Atlantic Oscillation INDEX (Välisuo et al., 2018; Ruan et al., 2019; Sherman et al., 2020), especially in West Greenland (Bevis et al., 2019), Greenland Ice Sheet melt is more strongly correlated with the Greenland Blocking INDEX (Hanna et al., 2016, 2018) than with the summer North Atlantic Oscillation INDEX (Huai et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_9_14,9,47,"The SROCC reported with medium confidence that around half of the 1960–2014 Greenland Ice Sheet surface meltwater ran off, while most of the remainder infiltrated firn and snow, where it either refroze or accumulated in firn aquifers. Studies since SROCC show a decrease of firn air content between 1998–2008 and 2010–2017 (Vandecrux et al., 2019) in the low-accumulation percolation area of western Greenland, reducing meltwater retention capacity. Moreover, meltwater infiltration into firn can be strongly limited by low-permeability ice slabs created by refreezing of infiltrated meltwater (Machguth et al., 2016). Recent observations and modelling efforts INDICate that rapidly expanding low-permeability layers have led to an increase in runoff area since 2001 (MacFerrin et al., 2019). In summary, there is medium confidence that meltwater storage and refreezing can temporarily buffer a large-scale melt increase, but limiting factors have been identified. The SROCC reported that there was medium confidence that ocean temperatures near the grounding zone of tidewater glaciers are critically important to their calving rate, but there was low confidence in understanding their response to ocean forcing. The increase in ice discharge in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Mouginot et al., 2019; King et al., 2020; Mankoff et al., 2020) has been associated with a period of widespread tidewater glacier retreat (Murray et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2021) and speed up (Moon et al., 2020). Since SROCC, new studies provide strong evidence for rapid submarine melting at tidewater glaciers (Sutherland et al., 2019; Wagner et al., 2019; Bunce et al., 2020; R.H. Jackson et al., 2020). Changes in submarine melting and subglacial meltwater discharge can trigger increased ice discharge by reducing the buttressing to ice flow and promoting calving (Benn et al., 2017; Todd et al., 2018; Ma and Bassis, 2019; Mercenier et al., 2020); through undercutting (Rignot et al., 2015; D.A. Slater et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2018; Fried et al., 2019) and frontal incision (Cowton et al., 2019). Warming ocean waters have been implicated in the recent thinning and breakup of floating ice tongues in north-eastern and north-western Greenland (Mouginot et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2017; Mayer et al., 2018; Washam et al., 2018; An et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2021). On decadal time scales, tidewater glacier terminus position correlates with submarine melting (Slater et al., 2019). Over shorter time scales, individual glaciers or clusters of glaciers can behave differently and asynchronously (Bunce et al., 2018; Vijay et al., 2019; An et al., 2021), and there are not always clear associations between water temperature and glacier calving rates (Motyka et al., 2017), retreat or speed-up (Joughin et al., 2020; Solgaard et al., 2020). Variations in ice mélange at the front of a glacier, associated with changes in ocean and air temperature, have also emerged as a plausible control on calving (Burton et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2019; Joughin et al., 2020). In summary, there is high confidence that warmer ocean waters and increased subglacial discharge of surface melt at the margins of marine-terminating glaciers increase submarine melt, which leads to increased ice discharge. There is medium confidence that this contributed to the increased rate of mass loss from Greenland, particularly in the period 2000–2010 when increased discharge was observed in the south-east and north-west. The SROCC reported that accurate bedrock topography is required for understanding and projecting the glacier response to ocean forcing. Accurate bathymetry is essential for establishing which water masses enter glacial fjords, and for reliable estimates of the submarine melt rates experienced by tidewater glaciers (Schaffer et al., 2020; T. Slater et al., 2020; Wood et al., 2021). Subglacial and lateral topography is known to strongly modulate tidewater glacier dynamics and the sensitivity of tidewater glaciers to climatic forcing (Enderlin et al.,"
AR6_WG1_9_15,9,48,"The SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019) stated that there is low confidence in understanding coastal glacier response to ocean forcing because submarine melt rates, calving rates, bed and fjord geometry and the roles of ice mélange and subglacial discharge are poorly understood. Ice–ocean interactions remain poorly understood and difficult to model, with parametrizations often used for calving of marine-terminating glaciers (Mercenier et al., 2018) and submarine and plume-driven melt (Beckmann et al., 2019). Due to the difficulties of modelling the large number of marine-terminating glaciers and limited availability of high-resolution bedrock data, the majority of recent modelling work on Greenland outlet glaciers is focused on individual or a limited number of glaciers (Krug et al., 2014; Bondzio et al., 2016, 2017; Morlighem et al., 2016b; Muresan et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Beckmann et al., 2019), or a specific region (Morlighem et al., 2019). Since SROCC, using a flowline model that includes calving and submarine melting, Beckmann et al. (2019) concluded that the AR5 upscaling of contributions from four of the largest glaciers (Nick et al., 2013) overestimated the total glacier contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet, due to differences in response between large and small glaciers. The regional study of Morlighem et al. (2019) confirms that ice–ocean interactions have the potential to trigger extensive glacier retreat over decadal time scales, as INDICated by observations (Section 9.4.1.1). One focus of continental ice-sheet models has been the improved treatment of marine-terminating glaciers via the inclusion of calving processes and freely moving calving fronts (Aschwanden et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2021). An improved bedrock topographic dataset (Morlighem et al., 2017) allows for ice discharge to be better captured for outlet glaciers in continental ice-sheet models, and simulations INDICate that bedrock topography controls the magnitude and rate of retreat (Aschwanden et al., 2019; Rückamp et al., 2020). Overall, although there is high confidence that the dynamic response of Greenland outlet glaciers is controlled by bedrock topography, there is low confidence in quantification of future mass loss from Greenland triggered by warming ocean conditions, due to limitations in the current understanding of ice–ocean interactions, its implementation in ice-sheet models, and knowledge of bedrock topography."
AR6_WG1_9_16,9,51,"2015; Calov et al., 2018; Aschwanden et al., 2019). Since SROCC, a new study gives a sea level contribution of 0.11 to 0.20 m in low- emissions scenarios and 0.61 to 1.29 m in high-emissions scenarios (Van Breedam et al., 2020). The low-emissions projections by Van Breedam et al. (2020) encompass AR5’s assessed contribution, while the high emissions projections are higher than that from AR5. The ‘optimal’ ensemble member of Aschwanden et al. (2019) (see also Section 9.4.1.3) INDICates that Greenland could contribute 0.25 m under RCP2.6 and 1.74 m under RCP8.5. Structured expert judgement (Bamber et al., 2019) projects Greenland losses of 0.54 (0.28–1.28) m under 2°C warming and 0.97 (0.4–2.23) m under 5°C warming. These studies therefore agree that the AR5 and SROCC assessments are at the low end of the range of projections. In addition, observations suggest that Greenland Ice Sheet losses are tracking the upper range of AR5 projections (T. Slater et al., 2020). Therefore, we update the likely range for the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to global mean sea level (GMSL) by 2300 to 0.11–0.25 m under RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6 and 0.31–1.74 m under RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5. However, given the uncertainty in climatic drivers used to project ice-sheet change over the 21st century (Goelzer et al., 2020; Hofer et al., 2020; Noël et al., 2021) and the large range in simulations since AR5 extending beyond 2100, we only have low confidence in the contribution to GMSL by 2300 and beyond."
AR6_WG1_9_17,9,51,"Accounting for more detailed feedbacks between the atmosphere and the ice sheet (Gregory et al., 2020) found a gradual relationship between sustained global mean warming and the corresponding near- equilibrium ice-sheet volume, in contrast to a sharp threshold as found by Robinson et al. (2012). Rather than a climatically controlled tipping point for irreversible loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet, Gregory et al. (2020) found a threshold of irreversibility linked to ice-sheet size, similar to previous work (Ridley et al., 2010). The results of Gregory et al. (2020) show that, if the ice sheet loses mass equivalent to about 3–3.5 m of sea level rise, it would not regrow to its present state, and 2 m of the sea level rise would be irreversible. The point in time at which the current ice sheet might reach this critical volume depends on oceanic and atmospheric conditions, ice dynamics, and climate–ice sheet feedbacks (Gregory et al., 2020; Van Breedam et al., 2020). Therefore, projections differ in the magnitude and rate of temperature change to cross the threshold for irreversible loss. Projections from a large ensemble INDICate that the mass threshold may be reached in as early as 400 years under extended RCP8.5 if warming reaches 10°C or more above present levels (Aschwanden et al., 2019). In summary, there is high confidence in the existence of threshold behaviour of the Greenland Ice Sheet in a warmer climate; however, there is low agreement on the nature of the thresholds and the associated tipping points. Model Intercomparison Projects and SROCC (Oppenheimer et al., 2019) were assessed by collecting et al., 2019b).

AR6_WG1_9_18,9,55,"Ongoing grounding line retreat, INDICating dynamic thinning, is observed with high confidence in many areas of Antarctica, and particularly on the WAIS, with the highest rates being in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea areas, and around Totten Glacier in East Antarctica, as stated in SROCC. Research published since SROCC has evidenced grounding line retreat of the West Antarctic Berry Glacier on the Getz Coast (Millan et al., 2020) and on the East Antarctic Denman Glacier (Brancato et al., 2020), both since 1996. Furthermore observed grounding line retreat in excess of 1.5 km between 2003 and 2015 has been reported for parts of Marie Byrd Land (Christie et al., 2018). In summary, there is high confidence that grounding lines of marine-terminating glaciers are currently retreating in many areas around Antarctica, particularly around the WAIS, and additional areas of grounding line retreat have been evidenced since SROCC."
AR6_WG1_9_19,9,55,"The SROCC stated with medium confidence that sustained mass losses of several major glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) are compatible with the onset of marine ice sheet instability (MISI). However, whether unstable WAIS retreat had begun, or was imminent, remained a critical uncertainty. New publications since SROCC have not substantially clarified this question. One study that combined satellite measurements with a numerical model and prescribed ice-shelf thinning (Gudmundsson et al., 2019) suggests that MISI is not required to explain the observed current mass loss rates of the WAIS, because they are consistent with external climate drivers. Furthermore, the fast grounding line retreat of the Pine Island Glacier in the ASE, which was triggered in the 1940s (Smith et al., 2017), observed after 1992 (Rignot et al., 2014) and previously interpreted as a sign of MISI (Favier et al., 2014), seems to have stabilized recently (Milillo et al., 2017; Konrad et al., 2018), and its current flow patterns do not suggest ongoing or imminent MISI (Bamber and Dawson, 2020). However, sustained fast grounding line retreat has been observed for the Smith Glacier in the ASE (Scheuchl et al., 2016), and an analysis of flow patterns and grounding line retreat of the ASE Thwaites Glacier between 1992 and 2017 (Milillo et al., 2019) showed sustained, albeit spatially heterogeneous, grounding line retreat, highlighting ice–ocean interactions that lead to increased basal melt. In addition, Denman Glacier in East Antarctica was shown to hold potential for unstable retreat (Brancato et al., 2020). In summary, the observed evolution of the ASE glaciers is compatible with, but not unequivocally INDICating an ongoing MISI (medium confidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_20,9,59,"The SROCC noted limited evidence from geological records and ice-sheet modelling, suggesting that parts of the AIS experienced rapid (centennial) retreat likely due to MISI between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago, and also described more uncertain evidence for the Last Interglacial (LIG) and mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP). Recent support for past MISI is provided by model simulations of the WAIS during the LIG (Clark et al., 2020), the British Ice Sheet during the last termination (Gandy et al., 2018) and the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Younger Dryas (Pico et al., 2019), which show progressive retreat despite declining temperatures, INDICative of a true (ice dynamic) instability. Direct observational evidence of rapid paleo ice-sheet grounding line retreat is rare but, on the Larsen continental shelf, retreat rates of >10 km yr –1 during the deglaciation have been estimated (Dowdeswell et al., 2020). MISI has also been inferred from sedimentological evidence of ice loss from Wilkes Subglacial Basin, East Antarctica (Bertram et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 2018; Blackburn et al., 2020) but these reconstructions cannot unambiguously identify unstable from progressive retreat. Therefore, there is limited evidence to identify the operation of instability mechanisms such as MISI in paleo ice-sheet retreat."
AR6_WG1_9_21,9,60,"Since SROCC, new projections have arisen from multi-model intercomparison projects ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2 (Box 9.3) and one model that includes MICI (Section 9.4.2.4; Table 9.3; DeConto et al., 2021). Corrections are added to allow comparison: all ISMIP6-derived projections have an estimate of the historical dynamical response to pre-2015 climate forcing added, which increases contributions (Box 9.3; Figure 9.18); the LARMIP-2 dynamic projections are combined with an estimate of SMB, which decreases contributions (Sections 9.4.2.3 and 9.6.3.2); and the ISMIP6 emulated and LARMIP-2 projections were re-estimate using the global surface air temperature distributions from the two-layer energy budget emulator described in Supplementary Material 7.SM.2. The majority of the new projections INDICate that, under all emissions scenarios, the AIS will lose mass overall and contribute to sea level rise. Most thinning occurs in the Amundsen Sea sector in WAIS and Totten Glacier in EAIS (Figure 9.18). The most negative contribution is –0.02 m (5th percentile of ISMIP6 combined RCP8.5 and SSP5‑8.5 projections after correction) and the largest contribution is 0.57 m SLE (95th percentile; Levermann et al., 2020), or 0.63 m SLE with MICI (95th percentile; DeConto et al., 2021). ISMIP6 ensemble ranges are wider for the high scenarios (RCP8.5/SSP5‑8.5) than the low (RCP2.6/SSP1‑2.6), in part because more simulations were available. The ISMIP6 simulations that apply an ice-shelf collapse scenario based on exceedance of a surface meltwater threshold (Trusel et al., 2015), driven by CMIP5 models, show only a small increase in mass loss (around 0–0.04 m), mostly from the Peninsula, due in part to the small number of ice shelves predicted to collapse this century (Seroussi et al., 2020). Simulations driven by the CMIP5 model HadGEM2-ES, which has unusually extreme warming in the Ross Sea (Barthel et al., 2020), show a larger mass loss (up to about 0.05 m) in East Antarctica under ice-shelf collapse (Edwards et al., 2021). The ISMIP6 projections do not include the efficient meltwater drainage or atmospheric feedbacks that could reduce mass loss further (Seroussi et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_9_22,9,65,"The glacier mass loss rate from geodetic mass balance assessments in the Southern Andes during 2006–2015 was smaller (720 ± 70 kg m –2 yr –1 ; Braun et al., 2019; Dussaillant et al., 2019; Hugonnet et al., 2021) than previously assessed in SROCC (860 ± 160 kg m –2 yr –1 ), though within uncertainties. In the Central and Desert regions of the Southern Andes, an increase in mass loss from 2000–2009 to 2010–2018, and a high loss rate in Patagonia for the whole period, are observed (Dussaillant et al., 2019). Records of glacier mass loss in Peru (Seehaus et al., 2019a) and Bolivia (Seehaus et al., 2019b) in the period 2000–2016 show an increase in mass loss towards the end of the observation period. In western North America, outside of Alaska and western Yukon, there was a fourfold increase in mass loss for 2009–2018 (860 ± 320 kg m –2 yr –1 ) compared to 2000–2009 (203 ± 214 kg m –2 yr –1 ; Menounos et al., 2019), and in the Canadian Arctic there was a doubling of mass loss in the last two decades compared with pre-1996 (Noël et al., 2018; Cook et al., 2019). The peripheral glaciers in NE Greenland experienced a 23% increase in mass loss in 1980–2014 compared to the period 1910 to 1978–1987 (Carrivick et al., 2019). In Iceland, 16 ± 4% of the around 1890 glacier mass has been lost; about half of that loss occurred in the period 1994–2019 (Aðalgeirsdóttir et al., 2020). Glacier records starting in 1960 in Norway show that half of the observed glaciers advanced in the 1990s but all have retreated since 2000 (Andreassen et al., 2020). In Svalbard, glaciers have been losing mass since the 1960s, with a tendency towards more negative mass balance since 2000 (Deschamps-Berger et al., 2019; Van Pelt et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2020; Noël et al., 2020; Schuler et al., 2020). A similar increase in mass loss has been observed for Franz Josef Land in the Russian Arctic (Zheng et al., 2018). Rapid retreat and downwasting throughout the European Alps in the early 21st century is reported (Sommer et al., 2020) and long-term records, although limited, INDICate sustained glacier mass loss in High Mountain Asia since around 1850, with increased mass loss in recent decades (Shean et al., 2020). In summary, although interannual variability is high in many regions, glacier mass records throughout the world show with very high confidence that the loss rate has been increasing in the last two decades (see also Section 8.3.1.7.1 and 12.4 for regional glacier assessment)."
AR6_WG1_9_23,9,66,"In the Northern Hemisphere, where summer insolation decreased during the Holocene (Section 2.2.1), glaciers generally waxed (Briner et al., 2016; Kaufman et al., 2016; Lecavalier et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Axford et al., 2019; Geirsdóttir et al., 2019; Larsen et al., 2019; Luckman et al., 2020). Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, where summer insolation increased during the Holocene, glaciers generally waned (Solomina et al., 2015; Kaplan et al., 2016; Reynhout et al., 2019). However, these general global trends were modulated by regional climate variations in temperature and precipitation (Murari et al., 2014; Kaplan et al., 2016; Batbaatar et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2018) and there are a number of examples of this. A precipitation increase led to a local early Holocene (7–8 ka) glacier maximum in arid Mongolia (Gichginii Range). Glacier advances at about 9 ka in south- west Greenland have been suggested to be a consequence of the freshwater pulse from the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which led to cooling in the Baffin Bay area (Schweinsberg et al., 2018). Lake sediments INDICate that the glaciers in the region were smaller than today, or absent between 8.6 and 1.4 ka (Larocca et al., 2020). Glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula and in Patagonia during the Holocene were strongly affected by the southern westerly winds, sea ice extent, and ocean circulation (García et al., 2020). Recent studies INDICate that explosive volcanism can drive glacier advances (Solomina et al., 2015, 2016; Schweinsberg et al., 2018; Brönnimann et al., 2019). In summary, on millennial time scales over the Holocene, there is high confidence that orbital forcing drove hemispheric-scale glacier variations, but new studies provide a nuanced picture of responses to a variety of regional-scale forcings."
AR6_WG1_9_24,9,68,"Since SROCC, Marzeion et al. (2020) projected 21st century global- scale glacier mass changes based on seven global-scale and four regional-scale glacier models (Annex II). All models used the same initial and boundary conditions, forming a more coherent ensemble of projections compared to SROCC. Nevertheless, challenges remain because of scarcity of glacier thickness, surface mass balance (SMB) and frontal ablation data for model calibration, but also due to uncertainties in glacier outlines, surface elevations and ice velocities. The global SMB models are of varying complexity, including mass balance sensitivity approaches (van de Wal and Wild, 2001), temperature-INDEX methods (Anderson and Mackintosh, 2012; Marzeion et al., 2012; Radić et al., 2014; Huss and Hock, 2015; Kraaijenbrink et al., 2017; Maussion et al., 2019; Zekollari et al., 2019; Rounce et al., 2020) and simplified energy balance calculations (Sakai and Fujita, 2017; Shannon et al., 2019). Compared to simpler, empirical parametrizations, full energy-balance models are not necessarily the most appropriate choice for simulating future glacier response to climate change, even at the local scale (Réveillet et al., 2017, 2018), because of parameter and forcing uncertainties. All models account for glacier retreat and advance, but only two models (Anderson and Mackintosh, 2012; Huss and Hock, 2015) include frontal ablation."
AR6_WG1_9_25,9,69,"Lüthi et al., 2010; Zekollari et al., 2020). The models INDICate that the disequilibrium between the glaciers and present atmospheric conditions (1995 to 2014) reduces and then disappears at around year 2070 (Marzeion et al., 2020). There is therefore very high confidence that the disequilibrium of glaciers will persist as warming continues, and that glaciers will continue to lose mass for at least several decades because of their lagged response, even if global temperature is stabilized."
AR6_WG1_9_26,9,71,"Based on multiple studies, there is medium confidence that widespread retreat of coastal permafrost is accelerating in the Arctic (Günther et al., 2015; Cunliffe et al., 2019; Isaev et al., 2019). There is also consistent evidence of complete permafrost thaw in areas of discontinuous and sporadic permafrost since about 1980, but this evidence is geographically scattered (Camill, 2005; Kirpotin et al., 2011; James et al., 2013; B.M. Jones et al., 2016; Borge et al., 2017; Chasmer and Hopkinson, 2017; Gibson et al., 2018). In spite of increasing evidence of landscape changes from site studies and remote sensing, quantifying permafrost extent change remains challenging because it is a subsurface phenomenon that cannot be observed directly (Jorgenson and Grosse, 2016; Trofaier et al., 2017). A modelling study for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau between the 1960s and the 2000s (Ran et al., 2018) suggests transition from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground over an area of more than 400,000 km 2 In summary, there is medium confidence that complete permafrost thaw in recent decades is a common phenomenon in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost regions. In addition, paleoclimatic evidence presented in Section 2.3.2.5 confirms a long-term sensitivity of permafrost extent to climatic variations, although an analysis of North American speleothem records over the last two glacial cycles INDICates that this apparent high sensitivity could be a consequence of regional-scale variability (Batchelor et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_9_27,9,76,"There is high confidence that large inter-model variations in the snow-cover sensitivity to temperature can largely be explained by inaccuracies in the simulated snow-albedo feedback (Qu and Hall, 2014); a multi-model sub-ensemble of CMIP5 models that simulate a correct magnitude of this feedback presents a 40% reduced spread in the projected 21st century Northern Hemisphere land warming trend (Thackeray and Fletcher, 2016). Errors of the simulated feedback strength were linked to: (i) systematic positive albedo biases over the boreal forest belt, mostly due to unrealistic treatment of vegetation masking (Thackeray and Fletcher, 2016); (ii) inaccurate prescribed tree cover fraction and inappropriate parametrization of leaf area INDEX in some models (Loranty et al., 2014; L. Wang et al., 2016); and (iii) low spatial resolution leading to inaccuracies in the strength of the simulated snow albedo feedback in mountainous regions (Letcher and Minder, 2015). Although the representation of snow-albedo feedback improved in many CMIP5 models over CMIP3, some models deteriorated (Thackeray et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_9_28,9,78,"For both periods in the satellite era – that is, 1993–2018 and 2006–2018 – the sum of contributions is consistent with the total observed GMSL change (high confidence) (Table 9.5). However, the latter period, which is characterized by improved data quality and coverage associated with satellite and Argo observations, shows much closer agreement in the central estimates. The marginal sea level budget closure for the period 1993–2018 may INDICate underestimated uncertainty, which may be structural as well as parametric. The sea level budget assessments across the various periods in Table 9.5 demonstrate that the acceleration in GMSL rise (Section 2.3.3.3) since the late 1960s is mostly the result of increased ice-sheet mass loss. However, all contributions to GMSL rise show their largest rate during 2006–2018, with the ice sheets accounting for 27% of the total change during this period. Because of the increased ice-sheet mass loss, the total loss of land ice (glaciers and ice sheets) was the largest contributor to GMSL rise over the period 2006–2018 (high confidence)."

This section updates prior assessments of drivers of past GMSL changes and climatically coherent areas of relative sea level (RSL) variability. GMSL changes are framed in terms of global mean surface temperature (GMST) but noting that amplified high-latitude warming is a robust equilibrium response to elevated CO (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013): polar air temperatures during past warm periods were up to twice the GMST changes shown in Table 9.6. The SROCC assessment that past multi-metre sea level changes have resulted from significant ice-sheet changes beyond those presently observed is confirmed (very high confidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_30,9,83,"The MPWP climate had substantial polar amplification, up to 8°C above pre-industrial levels in Arctic Russia (Section 7.4.4.1; Fischer et al., 2018).

Southern Hemisphere glaciation was characterized by an Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) reduced in volume from the present (medium confidence) (Figure 9.18; Dowsett et al., 2016; Berends et al., 2019; Grant et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2020) with mountain ice fields in the Andes of South America (De Schepper et al., 2014). Ice-sheet models are inconsistent in the magnitude of the sea level contribution from Antarctica (DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Yan et al., 2016; Golledge et al., 2017b; Berends et al., 2019; DeConto et al., 2021) but near-field sedimentological reconstructions support precessionally modulated and eccentricity-paced multi-metre sea level contributions from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin over 3–5 kyr (Patterson et al., 2014; Bertram et al., 2018). In summary, under a past warming level of around 2.5°C–4°C, ice sheets in both hemispheres were reduced in extent compared to present (high confidence). Proxy-based evidence (Section 2.3.3.3) combined with numerical modelling INDICates that, on millennial time scales, the GMSL contribution arising from ice sheets was >5 m (high confidence) or >10 m (medium confidence) (Figures 9.17 and 9.18; Moucha and Ruetenik, 2017; Berends et al., 2019; Dumitru et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_9_31,9,84,"Recent LIG ice-sheet simulations agree that peak loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet occurred late (125–120 ka; Goelzer et al., 2016; Tabone et al., 2018; Plach et al., 2019) when Northern Hemisphere insolation was greater than at present (medium confidence) (Capron et al., 2017), consistent with inferences from marine sediment records (Hatfield et al., 2016; Irvalı et al., 2020) and far-field GMSL INDICATORs (Rohling et al., 2019). Best estimates of the GMSL contribution from Greenland (Figure 9.17) differ between models: ≤1 m (Albrecht et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2020), 1–2 m (Calov et al., 2015; Goelzer et al., 2016; Bradley et al., 2018), up to 3 m (Tabone et al., 2018; Plach et al., 2019), and >5 m (Yau et al., 2016). There is high confidence that the response time of the Greenland Ice Sheet to LIG warming was multi-millennial, and high confidence that it contributed to LIG GMSL change, but low agreement in the contribution magnitude."
AR6_WG1_9_32,9,84,"Far-field GMSL records suggest that the AIS contributed to LIG sea level from 129.5–125 ka (Figure 9.18) but direct evidence is sparse. Thinning of part of the WAIS is interpreted from a 130–80 ka hiatus in the Patriot Hills horizontal ice core record (Turney et al., 2020). Marine sediment records suggest a dynamic response of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin (WSB) of the EAIS during this period, INDICating a response time scale of 1000–2500 yr (Wilson et al., 2018), consistent with modelling studies (Mengel and Levermann, 2014; Golledge et al., 2017b; Sutter et al., 2020). Isotopic changes in the Talos Dome ice core are inconsistent with local surface lowering, limiting retreat to 0.4–0.8 m SLE from this sector (Sutter et al., 2020). Ice-sheet models forced with unmodified atmosphere–ocean models (Goelzer et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2020) simulate 3–4.4 m SLE mass loss, primarily from the WAIS, with no retreat in WSB (e.g., Figure 9.18). Models forced with proxy- based or ad hoc LIG ocean temperature anomalies (DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Sutter et al., 2016) INDICate collapse of West Antarctica under 2°C–3°C ocean forcing yielding 3–7.5 m sea level contribution, but modest or no retreat in the WSB. Based on limited evidence and limited agreement between models, there is low confidence in both the magnitude and timing of LIG mass loss from the AIS."
AR6_WG1_9_33,9,84,"In summary, paleo-environmental and modelling studies INDICate that, under past warming of the level achieved during the LIG (ca. 0.5°C–1.5°C), it is likely that both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets responded dynamically over multiple millennia (high confidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_34,9,84,"At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) geological proxies and GIA models INDICate that GMSL was 125–134 m below present (Section 2.3.3.3 and Figures 9.17 and 9.18). New studies have not changed AR5’s conclusions regarding the size or timing of the LGM and last glacial termination, but have further examined the LGM sea level budget. Based on a synthesis of multiple prior studies, (Simms et al., 2019) estimated central 67% probability contributions to the LGM lowstand (i.e., lowest levels during the LGM) of 76 ± 7 m from the North American Laurentide Ice Sheet, 18 ± 5 m from the Eurasian Ice Sheet, 10 ± 2 m from Antarctica, 4 ± 1 m from Greenland, 5.5 ± 0.5 m from glaciers, and 2.4 ± 0.3 m due to an increase in ocean density. Of the residual, up to about 1.4 m may be ascribed to groundwater, leaving a shortfall of 16 ± 10 m yet to be allocated among land ice reservoirs or lakes. 9.6.2.5 Last Deglacial Transition: Meltwater pulse 1A"
AR6_WG1_9_35,9,85,"and extent, there is medium confidence that minima were reached at different times in different areas during the period 8–3 ka BP (Larsen et al., 2015; Young and Briner, 2015; Briner et al., 2016). Geochronological and numerical modelling studies INDICate that it is likely (medium confidence) that the period of smaller-than-present ice extent in all sectors of Greenland persisted for at least 2000 to 3000 years (Larsen et al., 2015; Young and Briner, 2015; Briner et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2018). Based on ice-sheet modelling and carbon-14 ( 14 C) dating (Kingslake et al., 2018) suggested that West Antarctic grounding lines retreated prior to around 10 ka BP, followed by a readvance. Other studies from the same region conclude that retreat was fastest from 9–8 ka BP (Spector et al., 2017), or from 7.5–4.8 ka BP (Venturelli et al., 2020). Marine geological evidence INDICates open marine conditions east of Ross Island by 8.6 ± 0.2 ka BP (McKay et al., 2016). In the western Weddell Sea, Johnson et al. (2019) reported rapid glacier thinning from 7.5–6 ka BP. Hein et al. (2016) concluded that the fastest thinning further south took place from 6.5–3.5 ka BP, potentially contributing 1.4–2 m to GMSL. Geophysical data INDICate stabilization or readvance in this area around 6 ± 2 ka BP (Wearing and Kingslake, 2019). In coastal Dronning Maud Land (East Antarctica) rapid thinning occurred 9–5 ka BP (Kawamata et al., 2020), whereas glaciers in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula receded during the period 11–8 ka BP and readvanced to their maximal extents by 7–4 ka BP (Kaplan et al., 2020). In summary, higher-than-pre-industrial GMST during the mid-Holocene coincided with recession of the Greenland Ice Sheet to a smaller-than-present extent (high confidence). Multiple lines of evidence give high confidence that thinning or retreat in parts of Antarctica during the Holocene took place at different times in different places. However, limited data means there is only low confidence in whether or not the ice sheet as a whole was smaller than present during the mid-Holocene."
AR6_WG1_9_36,9,85,"In summary, both proxies and model simulations INDICate that GMSL changes during the early to mid-Holocene were the result of episodic pulses, due to drainage of meltwater lakes, superimposed on a trend of steady rise due to continued ice-sheet retreat (high confidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_37,9,85,"The combination of tide gauge observations and geological reconstructions INDICates that a sustained increase of GMSL began between 1820–1860 and led to a 20th-century GMSL rise that was very likely (high confidence) faster than in any preceding century in the last 3000 years (Section 2.3.3.3). At a regional level, tide gauge and geological data from the North Atlantic and Australasia show inflections in RSL trends between 1895–1935, with an increase of 0.8 to 2.5 mm yr –1 across the inflection (Gehrels and Woodworth, 2013). A statistical meta-analysis of globally distributed geological and tide gauge data (Kopp et al., 2016) found that, in all 20 examined regions with geological records stretching back at least 2000 years, the rate of RSL rise in the 20th century was greater than the local average over 0–1700 CE. In four of the 20 regions, all in the North Atlantic (Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Iceland), the 19th century rate was also greater than the 0–1700 CE average (90% confidence interval). In summary, rates of RSL rise exceeding the pre-industrial background rate of rise are apparent in parts of the North Atlantic in the 19th century (medium confidence), and in most of the world in the 20th century (high confidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_38,9,89,"To test the possible effect of additional ice-sheet processes for which there is low confidence (Sections 9.4.1.3, 9.4.1.4, 9.4.2.5, 9.4.2.6 and 9.6.3.1, and Box 9.4), two additional approaches are considered. For both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, we produce sensitivity cases employing the SEJ projections of Bamber et al. (2019), mapping 2°C and 5°C stabilization scenarios to SSP1‑2.6 and SSP5‑8.5, respectively. For the AIS, we produce an additional sensitivity case using projections, which incorporate MICI (DeConto et al., 2021), mapping projections for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 to SSP1‑2.6 and SSP5‑8.5. For the Greenland Ice Sheet, the SEJ projections INDICate the potential for outcomes outside the corresponding likely ranges (Table 9.8). For the AIS, there is no evidence from these studies to suggest an important role under lower-emissions scenarios for processes in whose projections we have low confidence. By contrast, for SSP5‑8.5, the SEJ and MICI projections exhibit 17th–83rd percentile ranges of 0.02–0.56 m and 0.19–0.53 m by 2100, consistent with one another but considerably broader than the likely contribution for medium confidence processes of 0.03–0.34 m. This lower level of agreement for higher-emissions scenarios reflects the deep uncertainty in the AIS contribution to GMSL change under higher-emissions scenarios (Box 9.4). This deep uncertainty grows after 2100: by 2150, under SSP5‑8.5, medium confidence processes likely lead to a –0.1–0.7 m AIS contribution, while SEJ- and MICI-based projections INDICate 0.0–1.1 m and 1.4–3.7 m, respectively. 9.6.3.2.5 Glaciers In AR5 and SROCC, global glacier mass changes were derived from a power law of integrated global mean surface temperature change fit to results from four different glacier models. The updated projections use emulated GlacierMIP projections (Section 9.5.1.3; Box 9.3). Since the GlacierMIP emulator does not account for temporal correlation and terminates, along with the GlacierMIP simulations, in 2100, we employ a parametric fit to the GlacierMIP simulations, with a functional form similar to that employed by AR5, to calculate rates of change and extrapolate changes beyond 2100 (up to a maximum potential contribution of 0.32 m; see Supplementary Material 9.SM.4.5). This approach leads to a median glacier contribution that is a minimal change (Table 9.8) from AR5 and SROCC and a modest narrowing of likely ranges (Section 9.5.1.3). For RCP2.6, AR5 projected 0.10 (0.04 to 0.16, likely range) m, compared to 0.09 (0.07 to 0.11) m projected for SSP1‑2.6. For RCP8.5, AR5 projected a likely contribution of 0.17 (0.09 to 0.25) m, compared to 0.18 (0.15 to 0.21) m projected here."
AR6_WG1_9_39,9,96,"Taking into account all these approaches, including published projections for RCP2.6, under SSP1‑2.6 GMSL will rise between 0.3 and 3.1 m by 2300 (low confidence). This projection range INDICates that, while SROCC projections under low emissions to 2300 are consistent with no ice-sheet acceleration after 2100, there is the possibility of a much broader range of outcomes at the high end, reflected in the range of published GMSL projections. Under SSP5‑8.5, GMSL will rise between 1.7 and 6.8 m by 2300 in the absence of MICI and by up to 16 m considering MICI, a wider range than AR5 or SROCC assessments, but consistent with published projections (low confidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_40,9,96,"On still longer time scales, AR5 concluded with low confidence that the multi-millennial GMSL commitment sensitivity to warming was about 1–3 m °C –1 GSAT increase. Two process-model studies since AR5 (Clark et al., 2016; Van Breedam et al., 2020) INDICate higher commitments (Figure 9.30). Ice sheets dominate the multi-millennial sea level commitment (Sections 9.4.1.4 and 9.4.2.6), but the two studies disagree on the relative contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Notably, processes such as MICI (Section 9.4.2.4) that are a major factor behind the deep uncertainty in century-scale AIS response do not appear to have a substantial effect on the multi-millennial magnitude (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Only one of the studies of multimillennial GMSL commitments includes scenarios consistent with 1.5°C of peak warming (Clark et al., 2016); this study suggests a 2000-year commitment at 1.5°C of about 2.3–3.1 m, with approximately an additional 1.4–2.3 m commitment between 1.5°C and 2.0°C (i.e., about 3 to 5 m °C –1 ). Taken together, both studies show a 2000-year GMSL commitment of about 2–6 m for peak warming of about 2°C, 4–10 m for 3°C, 12–16 m for 4°C, and 19–22 m for 5°C (medium agreement, limited evidence) (Table 9.10). GMSL rise continues after 2000 years, leading to a 10,000-year commitment of about 6–7 m for 1.5°C of peak warming (based on Clark et al., 2016), and based on both studies of about 8–13 m for 2.0°C, 10–24 m for 3.0°C, 19–33 m for 4.0°C, and 28–37 m for 5°C (medium agreement, limited evidence) (Table 9.10). An INDICative metric for the equilibrium sea level response can be provided by comparing paleo GSAT and GMSL during past multimillennial warm periods (Sections 2.3.1.1, 2.3.3.3 and 9.6.2; Figure 9.9). However, caution is needed as the present and past warm periods differ in astronomical and other forcings (Cross-chapter Box 2.1) and in terms of polar amplification. The Last Interglacial (likely 5–10 m higher GMSL than today and 0.5°C–1.5°C warmer than 1850–1900; Section 9.6.2; Table 9.6) is consistent with the Clark et al. (2016) projections for the 10,000-year commitment associated with 1.5°C of warming. Similarly, the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (very likely 5–25 m higher GMSL than today and very likely 2.5°C–4°C warmer) (Section 9.6.2; Table 9.6) is consistent with the range of 10,000-year commitments associated with 2.5–4°C"
AR6_WG1_9_41,9,97,"of warming, but GMSL reconstructions provide only a weak, broad constraint on model-based projections. An additional paleo constraint comes from the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, which INDICates that 10–18°C of warming is associated with ice-free conditions and a likely GMSL rise of 70–76 m (Sections 2.3.3 and 9.6.2). Together with model-based projections (Clark et al., 2016; Van Breedam et al., 2020), this period suggests that commitment to ice-free conditions would occur for peak warming of about 7°C–13°C (medium agreement, limited evidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_42,9,99,"As in AR5 and SROCC, tide gauge observations show that RSL rise (Section 9.6.1.3) is the primary driver of changes in ESWL at most locations and, across tide gauges, has led to a median 165% increase in high-tide flooding over 1995–2014 relative to those over 1960–1980 (high confidence) (Figure 9.31). Some locations exhibit substantial differences between long-term RSL trends and ESWL (high confidence), particularly given decadal to multi-decadal variations of other ESWL contributors (Rashid and Wahl, 2020). Since SROCC, RSL rise has been shown to be the dominant contributor to ESWL rise at most gauge sites along the Chinese coast, but, at some locations, the surge contribution dominates (Feng et al., 2019). Trends in the difference between ESWL and mean RSL rise of their plausible ranges (Sections 9.4.2.5 and 9.6.3.3; Table 9.7) or contributions to additional sea level rise at moderate levels. In both higher than the assessed likely range, as INDICated by the projections as 1.6 m at the 83rd percentile and 2.3 m at the 95th percentile identification of sites and observables that can provide early this and previous reports. One potential site for such monitoring is in others than models simulate. At this glacier, the effect of tides et al., 2019), making the floating ice shelf potentially vulnerable earlier than expected. In addition, the glacier is retreating towards would be reached in 30 years (Yu et al., 2019). Thwaites Glacier is MICI (Golledge et al., 2019; DeConto et al., 2021), making it the level rise from Antarctica. Such signals could possibly be observed can result from changes (either positive or negative) in the surge or tidal components, and can include non-linear interactions between tide, surge, and RSL (Arns et al., 2015; Schindelegger et al., 2018). The positive phase of the 18.6-year nodal cycle of the astronomical tide is a further consideration, contributing to an increased flood hazard relative to the long-term average (Talke et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019; Baranes et al., 2020). Failing to consider the non-linear interactions between tide, surge and RSL may overestimate trends in ESWL (low confidence) (Arns et al., 2020). In some regions, changes in ESWL depend more on changes in surge or tide than on sea level trends."
AR6_WG1_9_43,9,99,"The AR5 INDICated that the amplitude and phase of major tidal constituents have exhibited long-term change, but that their effects on ESL were not well understood. The SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) reported changes in tides (amplification and dampening) at some locations to be of comparable importance to changes in mean sea level for explaining changes in high water levels, with the sign of change being dependent on stability of shoreline position. RSL rise causes water depth-based alterations to the resonant characteristics"
AR6_WG1_9_44,9,100,"of the basin, changes the bottom friction and increases the wave speed (Pickering et al., 2012) and remains the primary hypothesis for observed tidal changes. Other contributing processes include strong localized anthropogenic drivers (e.g., port development, dredging, flood defences, land reclamation), changes in stratification associated with ocean warming (Section 9.2.1.3), and changes in seabed roughness associated with ecological change (e.g., Haigh et al., 2019). Tide gauge data show that, although principal tidal components have varied in amplitude on the order of 2% to 10% per century (Jay, 2009; Ray, 2009), identifying direct causality remains challenging (Haigh et al., 2019). Combined, observations and models INDICate RSL rise and direct anthropogenic factors are the primary drivers of observed tidal changes at tide gauge stations (medium confidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_45,9,100,"deployments of in situ measurements in the very dynamic surf zone means that long-term records of ETWL or ECWL are limited to a few sites; tidal gauges are typically located in sheltered locations (e.g., harbours) where wave contributions are absent (Lambert et al., 2020). Consequently, trends in wave contributions to ESL are typically derived from trends in wave conditions observed offshore. On the basis of satellite altimeter observations, SROCC reported increasing extreme wave heights in the Southern and North Atlantic oceans of around 1.0 and 0.8 cm yr –1 , respectively, over the period 1985–2018 (medium confidence). The SROCC (Collins et al., 2019) also identified sea ice loss in the Arctic as leading to increased wave heights over the period 1992–2014 (medium confidence). Since SROCC, the satellite wave record has been shown to be sensitive to alternate processing techniques, leading to important differences in reported trends (Timmermans et al., 2020). The most common observation platforms for surface waves over the past 30 years are in situ buoys. However, evolving biases associated with changing instrument type, configuration and sampling methodology introduce artificial trends (e.g., Gemmrich et al., 2011; Timmermans et al., 2020). Accurate metadata is required to address these issues, and, while available locally, are only beginning to be globally coordinated (Centurioni et al., 2019). Wave reanalysis and hindcast products have also been used to investigate total water level at global scale (Melet et al., 2018; Reguero et al., 2019). Their applicability for trend analysis is limited by inhomogeneous data for assimilation (Stopa et al., 2019), but they inform relationships between seasonal, interannual to inter-decadal variability of climate INDICES and wind- wave characteristics (A.G. Marshall et al., 2015, 2018; Kumar et al., 2016; Stopa et al., 2016). To summarize, satellite era trends in wave heights of order 0.5 cm yr –1 have been reported, most pronounced in the Southern Ocean. However, sensitivity of processing techniques, inadequate spatial distribution of observations, and homogeneity issues in available records limit confidence in reported trends (medium confidence)."
AR6_WG1_9_46,9,104,"Correlations between changes in sea level-forced (mean sea level and tidal) and atmospherically-forced drivers (ocean surface waves and surges) of ESLs have only been considered in a few studies, although high surge and high waves co-occur along a majority of the world’s coastlines (Marcos et al., 2019). Along the east coast fo the USA, ocean dynamic sea level change and change in power dissipation INDEX (a proxy for North Atlantic tropical cyclone activity) are correlated across CMIP5 GCMs, resulting in an increase in ESLs relative to analyses assuming independence of these changes (Little et al., 2015). In the Irish Sea, dynamically coupled wave-tide modelling results in high water wave heights up to 20% higher than in an uncoupled analysis (Lewis et al., 2019). In the German Bight, RSL rise relaxes the breaking criterion of nearshore waves (assuming no geomorphological response), allowing larger waves to propagate closer to shore, leading to increased wave runup (Arns et al., 2017). In south-western Australia, the influence of projected SLR was found to exceed the influence of projected changes in forcing winds on wave characteristics at the coast (Wandres et al., 2017). Thus, projections of ESL that do not consider correlations between and among sea level forced and atmospherically forced drivers can differ strongly from coupled projections (medium confidence)."

These spatial length scales range from a few thousand down to a few kilometres and the relevant driving modes and processes at regional scales are summarized in Figure 10.3.

The regional reanalyses also incorporate uncertainties due to deficiencies of the models, data assimilation schemes and observations. To estimate uncertainties, some regional reanalyses apply data assimilation using ensemble forecasts (Bach et al., 2016). Another approach compares multiple regional reanalyses produced with different systems covering the same domain, which represents the uncertainties better than single reanalysis systems with ensemble data assimilation schemes (Kaiser-Weiss et al., 2019). The regional reanalyses represent the frequencies of extremes and the distributions of precipitation, surface air temperature, and surface wind better than global reanalyses (high confidence). This is due to the use of high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs), as INDICated by different regional climate modelling studies (Mesinger et al., 2006; Bollmeyer et al., 2015; Bromwich et al., 2016, 2018; Dahlgren et al., 2016; Jermey and Renshaw, 2016; Fukui et al., 2018; Su et al., 2019). Regional reanalyses, however, retain uncertainties due to deficiencies in the physical parametrization used in RCMs and by the use of relatively simple data assimilation algorithms (Bromwich et al., 2016; Jermey and Renshaw, 2016; Su et al., 2019). Regional reanalyses can provide estimates that are more consistent with observations than dynamical downscaling approaches, due to the assimilation of additional local observations (high confidence) (Bollmeyer et al., 2015; Fukui et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_10_8,10,23,"Data scarcity arises largely due to the lack of maintenance of observing stations, inaccessibility of the data held in national networks, and uneven spatial distribution of stations that lead to a low density in many regions. This is particularly problematic when trying to assess regional climate change, for which a high density of observational data is desirable. Although in several regions numerous stations provide (monthly) data covering more than 100 years for both temperature and precipitation (GCOS, 2015), large areas of the world remain sparsely covered. The post-1990 decline in the total number of stations contributing to the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) monthly product may be related to delays in data acquisition and not paucity of data (GCOS, 2015). This is because GPCC is the result of a single time scale, single Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and single data collection centre. There is no similar drop-off of the rainfall reports in the Global Historical Climatology Network Daily database (GHCNd, Menne et al., 2012) or the Integrated Surface Database (ISD) at the sub-daily time scale. Kidd et al. (2017) made some assumptions about GPCC-available gauges and INDICated that only 1.6% of Earth’s surface lies within 10 km of a rain gauge, and many areas of the world are beyond 100 km from the nearest rain gauge. Data scarcity is especially critical over Africa (Nikulin et al., 2012; Dike et al., 2018) but the apparent data scarcity could be due to reasons other than actual paucity of data, as stated earlier. For instance, over South Africa, the number of weather stations collecting daily temperature used in the fourth version of the Climatic Research Unit Temperature dataset (CRUTEM4, Osborn and Jones, 2014) has significantly declined since 1980 (Archer et al., 2018). Although CRUTEM4 has now been replaced by CRUTEM5 (Osborn et al., 2021) it has yet to take advantage of the significant international efforts to curate and make available improved global holdings (Rennie et al., 2014) which increased the global available station count for monthly mean temperatures. This includes additional stations from many African countries. The apparent decline in stations since the 1980s could also be due to countries not contributing their data to the SYNOP/CLIMAT networks for reasons other than having non-operational stations. Even in Europe, precipitation station density in the widely used E-OBS gridded dataset varies largely in space and time across regions (Prein and Gobiet, 2017). This variability is partly due to the reluctance of some data owners to share their data with an international effort. Regardless of the reason, low station density is a major source of uncertainty (Isotta et al., 2015). Kirchengast et al. (2014) and O and Foelsche (2019) found that at least 2 to 5 (12) stations are required for capturing the area-averaged precipitation amount of heavy summer precipitation events on a daily (hourly) basis with a normalized root- mean-square error of less than 20%. Like the E-OBS dataset, gridded daily temperature and precipitation datasets are being developed for other regions of the world. Examples include south-east Asia (SA-OBS, Van den Besselaar et al., 2017), and Latin America and West Africa (ICA&D, Van den Besselaar et al., 2015). Despite the uneven distribution of stations in space and time, the value in these initiatives is illustrated by the large number of studies in which the data product is used. This is the case, for instance, in the work of Condom et al. (2020) over the Andes, a region with prominent data scarcity, and the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses project over West Africa (AMMA; e.g., Lebel and Ali, 2009). There have been efforts to reduce data scarcity through initiatives such as the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI, Thorne et al., 2011), GHCND, and the Expanding Met Office Hadley Centre ISD with quality-controlled, sub-daily station data from 1931 (HadISD, Dunn et al., 2016). Data scarcity arising from changing coverage in observation station networks results in substantial problems for climate monitoring (e.g., trend analysis of extreme events requires high temporal and spatial resolutions) or model evaluation (Section 10.3.3.1). It is virtually certain that the scarcity and decline of observational availability in"

Uncertainty due to interpolation is typically small for temperature but substantial for precipitation and its derivatives, such as drought INDICES (Chubb et al., 2015; Hellwig et al., 2018). The largest uncertainties typically occur in sparsely sampled mountain areas (Section 10.2.2.5). Interpolation generally give rise to smoothing effects, such as low variability of the derived dataset with respect to the in situ observations (Chen et al., 2019). As a result, the effective resolution of gridded data is typically much lower than its nominal resolution. For instance, a 5 km gridded precipitation dataset for the European Alps has an effective resolution of about 10 to 25 km (Isotta et al., 2014). In an example for precipitation in Spain, the effective resolution converged to the nominal resolution only when at least 6 to 7 stations were inside the gridcell (Herrera et al., 2019). To account for the smoothing errors, new stochastic ensemble observation datasets have been introduced (Von Clarmann, 2014)."
AR6_WG1_10_10,10,24,"Spatiotemporal variability of meteorological parameters observed over mountainous areas is often large, INDICating strong control exerted by local topography on meteorological parameters (Gultepe et al., 2014). Difficult access, harsh climatic conditions as well as instrumental issues make meteorological measurements extremely challenging at higher elevations (Azam et al., 2018; Beniston et al., 2018). Measurements of wind speed, temperature, relative humidity and radiative fluxes are critical for climate model evaluation, but difficult to handle due to their point-scale representativeness and small-scale spatiotemporal variability over mountainous terrain, and often need adjustment (Gultepe, 2015). High-altitude (>3000 metres) permanent meteorological stations are limited and current knowledge is mainly based on valley-bottom or low-elevation meteorological stations (Qin et al., 2009; Lawrimore et al., 2011; Gultepe, 2015; Condom et al., 2020), which, generally do not represent the higher elevation climate (Immerzeel et al., 2015; Shea et al., 2015)."
AR6_WG1_10_11,10,28,"Gutowski Jr. et al., 2016) provides ensembles of high-resolution historical (starting as early as 1950) and future climate projections for various regions. RCMs in CORDEX typically have a horizontal resolution between 10 and 50 km. But much finer spatial resolution is required to fully resolve deep convection, an important cause of precipitation in much of the world. Therefore, an emerging strand in dynamical downscaling employs simulations at convection permitting scales, at horizontal resolutions of a few kilometres, where deep-convection parametrizations can be switched off, approximately simulating deep convection (Prein et al., 2015; Stratton et al., 2018; Coppola et al., 2020). A recent study INDICates that switching off the deep-convection parametrization may be beneficial also in simulations performed at coarser resolutions (Vergara-Temprado et al., 2020). Alternatively, some RCMs make use of scale-aware parametrizations that are able to adapt to increasing resolution without switching off the convection scheme (Hamdi et al., 2012; De Troch et al., 2013; Plant and Yano, 2015; Giot et al., 2016; Termonia et al., 2018; Yano et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_10_12,10,31,"Nudging experiments have been used to identify the relative roles of dynamic and thermodynamic processes in climate model biases and specific extreme events (Wehrli et al., 2018, 2019). Another related framework is used to evaluate the impact land conditions have on a climate phenomenon in a pair of experiments with one simulation serving as control run, and a perturbed simulation with prescribed land conditions (i.e., soil moisture, leaf area INDEX, or surface albedo) characterizing a specific state of the land surface (i.e., afforestation or deforestation). The difference between the perturbed and control simulations enables a robust assessment of the possible impact of land conditions on events like droughts and heatwaves (Seneviratne et al., 2013; Stegehuis et al., 2015; Hauser et al., 2016, 2017; van den Hurk et al., 2016; Vogel et al., 2017; Rasmijn et al., 2018; Strandberg and Kjellström, 2019)."
AR6_WG1_10_13,10,31,"While the ability of global models to simulate large-scale INDICATORs of climate change has improved since AR5 (Chapter 3), the simulation of regional climate and climate change poses an additional challenge. Users demand regional climate projections for decision-making and have high expectations regarding accuracy and resolution (Rössler et al., 2019a), but some scientists consider such projections still a matter of basic research (Hewitson et al., 2014a). For instance, large-scale circulation biases or the misrepresentation of regional topography as well as regional phenomena and feedbacks are very relevant (Hall, 2014; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). New global model ensembles such as CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016a), HighResMIP (Haarsma et al., 2016) or, at the regional scale, the convection permitting simulations from the CORDEX Flagship Pilot Study (FPS) on convective phenomena (Coppola et al., 2020) have the potential to substantially improve the basis for generating regional climate information, yet uncertainties and (often unresolved) contradictions between model projections at the regional scale can be substantial (Fernández et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_10_14,10,33,"Since AR5, model evaluation has made use of a broad combination of diagnostics (Colette et al., 2012; Kotlarski et al., 2014; Eyring et al., 2016b; Gleckler et al., 2016; Ivanov et al., 2017, 2018; Vautard et al., 2021), ranging from long-term means to INDICES of extreme events (Zhang et al., 2011; Sillmann et al., 2013) or a combination of these (Dittus et al., 2016). This evaluation has shown that global models have pervasive biases in some aspects of their large-scale behaviour (Section 1.5.3.1, Chapter 3). More complex diagnostics are used to characterize specific meteorological phenomena (Sprenger et al., 2017), such as feedbacks in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO; Bellenger et al., 2014), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) characteristics (Benedict et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2015; D. Kim et al., 2015; Ahn et al., 2017), extratropical modes of variability (Lee et al., 2019), cyclone tracking (Neu et al., 2013; Flaounas et al., 2018), front detection (Hope et al., 2014; Schemm et al., 2015), thunderstorm environment parameters (Bukovsky et al., 2017), African easterly waves (McCrary et al., 2014; Martin and Thorncroft, 2015), land–atmosphere coupling (Spennemann and Saulo, 2015; Santanello et al., 2018), and sea–atmosphere coupling (Bellenger et al., 2014; Mayer et al., 2017). New diagnostics for multivariate dependencies are needed to characterize compound events (Section 11.8; Hobaek Haff et al., 2015; Wahl et al., 2015; Sippel et al., 2016, 2017; Tencer et al., 2016; Bevacqua et al., 2017; Careto et al., 2018; Zscheischler et al., 2018). However, their success depends on the availability of adequate observational data (Section 10.2.2). Multivariate dependencies discovered in compound events can also be used for designing and evaluating multivariate bias adjustment and statistical downscaling. Process-based diagnostics are useful for identifying the cause of model errors, although it is not always possible to associate a systematic error with a specific cause (Eyring et al., 2019). AR5 discussed two approaches of process-based evaluation: (i) the isolation of physical components or parametrizations by dedicated experiments (Section 10.3.2.4) and (ii) diagnostics conditioned on relevant regimes, usually synoptic-scale weather patterns. The regime-based approach has been used with both global models (e.g., Barton et al., 2012; Catto et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2019) and RCMs (Endris et al., 2016; Bukovsky et al., 2017; Whan and Zwiers, 2017; Pinto et al., 2018), but also with perfect prognosis and bias adjustment methods (Marteau et al., 2015; Addor et al., 2016; Beranová and Kyselý, 2016; Soares and Cardoso, 2018; Soares et al., 2019b)."
AR6_WG1_10_15,10,34,"Downscaling is expected to improve the representation of a region’s climate compared to the driving global model (Di Luca et al., 2015). Arguably, there should be a clear physical reason for the improvement, which is applicable to the evaluation of added value in downscaled projections (Giorgi et al., 2016). The added value depends on the region, season, and governing physical processes (Lenz et al., 2017; Schaaf and Feser, 2018). Thus, added value of downscaling global model simulations is most likely where regional- and local-scale processes play an important role in a region’s climate, for example in complex or heterogeneous terrain such as mountains (Lee and Hong, 2014; Prein et al., 2016b), urban areas (Argüeso et al., 2014), along coastlines (Feser et al., 2011; Herrmann et al., 2011; Bozkurt et al., 2019), or where convective processes are important (Prein et al., 2015). Examples of model improvements and added value are given in the following subsections and the Atlas. A first step in determining added value in downscaling is to analyse whether the downscaling procedure gives detail on spatial or temporal scales not well-resolved by a global model, thus potentially representing climatic features missing in the GCM. This added detail, referred to as potential added value (PAV; Di Luca et al., 2012), is insufficient for demonstrating added value in downscaling (Takayabu et al., 2016), but lack of PAV INDICates that the downscaling method lacks usefulness. Added value is not guaranteed simply by producing model output at finer resolution. It depends on several factors, such as the simulation setup and the specific climatic variables analysed (Di Luca et al., 2012; Hong and Kanamitsu, 2014; Xue et al., 2014). A variety of performance measures are needed to assess added value (Section 10.3.3.1; Di Luca et al., 2016; Wilks, 2016; Ivanov et al., 2017, 2018; Soares and Cardoso, 2018)."
AR6_WG1_10_16,10,42,"Similar studies have been carried out for statistical downscaling and bias adjustment using predictors from reanalyses (or in case of bias adjustment, dynamically downscaled reanalyses). For a range of different perfect prognosis methods, Huth et al. (2015) found that simulated temperature trends were too strong for winter and too weak for summer. The performance was similar for the different methods, INDICating the importance of choosing informative predictors. Similarly, Maraun et al. (2019b) found that the performance of perfect prognosis methods depends mostly on the predictor and domain choice (for instance, temperature trends were only captured by those methods including surface temperature as predictor). Bias adjustment methods reproduced the trends of the driving reanalysis, apart from quantile mapping methods, which deteriorated these trends."
AR6_WG1_10_17,10,44,"Global model performance at the regional scale is assessed in terms of the time or spatial averages of key variables (see Atlas; Brunner et al., 2019), the ability to reproduce their seasonal cycle (Hasson et al., 2013) or a set of extreme climate INDICATORs (Chapter 11; Luo et al., 2020) and the representation of regional processes and phenomena, feedbacks, drivers and forcing impacts (Sections 10.3.3.4–10.3.3.6). In many cases, the performance estimates have been used to select models for either an application or a more in-depth study (Lovino et al., 2018), to select the models that provide boundary conditions to perform RCM simulations (McSweeney et al., 2015) or to weight the results of the global model simulations (Sanderson et al., 2015; Brunner et al., 2020). While some large-scale metrics are improved between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 experiments (Chapter 3; Cannon, 2020), there is not yet concluding evidence of a systematic improvement for surface variables at the regional scale."
AR6_WG1_10_18,10,46,"Since AR5, physical climate storyline approaches (see also Chapter 1, Section 10.5.3, Box 10.2, and Atlas.2.5.2) have been developed to better characterize and communicate uncertainties in regional climate projections (Shepherd, 2019). A special class of such storylines attempts to attribute regional uncertainties to uncertainties in remote drivers. For instance, the Dutch Meteorological Service has presented climate projections for the Netherlands for different plausible changes of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and different levels of European warming (van den Hurk et al., 2014). Manzini et al. (2014) have quantified the impact of uncertainties in tropical upper troposphere warming, polar amplification, and stratospheric wind change on Northern Hemisphere winter climate change. Based on these results, Zappa and Shepherd (2017) separated the multi-model ensemble into physically consistent sub-groups or storylines of qualitatively different projections in relevant remote drivers of the atmospheric circulation. In a similar vein, (Ose et al., 2020) trace uncertainties in projections of the East Asian summer monsoon and Mindlin et al.

AR6_WG1_10_21,10,56,"A positive trend in summer (December to February) precipitation has been detected in multiple observational sources in south-eastern South America since the beginning of the 20th century (Gonzalez et al., 2013; Vera and Díaz, 2015; Wu et al., 2016; H. Zhang et al., 2016; Díaz and Vera, 2017; Saurral et al., 2017). Sedimentary records from the Mar Chiquita lake INDICate that the last quarter of the 20th century was wetter than any period during the last 200 years (Piovano et al., 2004). In this attribution example the drivers contributing to the positive trend for the period 1951–2014 are discussed (Figure 10.12a). Precipitation anomalies of Climatic Research Unit Time Series (CRU TS) as well as for the two members of a SMILE with the most negative and positive trends for 1951–2014 are displayed in Figure 10.12b. The trend for 1951–2014 using CRU TS and GPCC is illustrated in Figure 10.12c, and for the region defined by the black quadrilateral, it amounts to 2.8 (CRU TS) – 3.5 (GPCC) mm per month and decade (see black crosses in Figure 10.12d) while the mean summer monthly precipitation for the same period is 104 (CRU TS) –109 (GPCC) mm. The trend is also detectable in daily and monthly extremes (Re and Barros, 2009; Marengo et al., 2010; Penalba and Robledo, 2010; Doyle et al., 2012; Donat et al., 2013; Lorenz et al., 2016)."
AR6_WG1_10_22,10,58,"Barreiro et al., 2014). Based on experiments designed to test how south-eastern South America precipitation is modulated by tropical Atlantic SSTs, Seager et al. (2010) showed that cold anomalies in the tropical Atlantic favour wetter conditions by inducing an upper-tropospheric flow towards the equator, which, via advection of vorticity, leads to ascending motion over south-eastern South America (Figure 10.12a). Monerie et al. (2019) supported this argument showing a negative relationship between south-eastern South America precipitation and the AMV INDEX (Huang et al., 2015) using an AGCM coupled to an ocean mixed-layer model with nudged SSTs. The positive trend of precipitation has also been attributed to anthropogenic GHG emissions and stratospheric ozone depletion. CMIP5 models only show a positive trend when including anthropogenic forcings (Vera and Díaz, 2015). These results were supported by Knutson and Zeng (2018) based on univariate detection/attribution analysis of annual mean trends for the 1901–2010 and 1951–2010 periods. However, the main features of summer mean precipitation and variability of South America are still not well-represented in all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015; Díaz and Vera, 2017; Díaz et al., 2021). This motivates the construction of ensembles that exclude the worst performing models (Section 10.3.3.4). The construction of ensembles of CMIP5 historical simulations with realistic representation of precipitation anomalies with opposite sign over south-eastern South America and eastern Brazil showed that the trend since the 1950s could be related to changes in precipitation characteristics only when simulations included anthropogenic forcings (Díaz and Vera, 2017). GHG emissions have been related to increased precipitation in south-eastern South America through three different mechanisms (Figure 10.12a). First, GHG warming induces a non-zonally uniform pattern of SST warming that includes a warming pattern over the Indian and Pacific oceans that excites wave responses over South America (Junquas et al., 2013). Zonally uniform SST patterns of warming alone lead to precipitation signals opposite to those observed in an AGCM (Junquas et al., 2013). Second, GHG radiative forcing drives an expansion of the Hadley cell so that its descending branch moves poleward from the region, generating anomalous ascending motion and precipitation (H. Zhang et al., 2016; Saurral et al., 2019). The third mechanism by which increased GHG can contribute to increased precipitation in the region is through a delay of the stratospheric polar vortex breakdown. As depicted in Figure 10.12a, both stratospheric ozone depletion and increased GHGs have contributed to the later breakdown of the polar vortex in recent decades (McLandress et al., 2010; Wu and Polvani, 2017; Ceppi and Shepherd, 2019). Mindlin et al. (2020) developed future atmospheric circulation storylines (Section 10.3.4.2, Box 10.2) for Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes with the CMIP5 models and found that for south-eastern South America summer precipitation, increases are related to the late-spring breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex. The connecting mechanism is through a lagged southward shift of the jet stream (Saggioro and Shepherd, 2019), which enhances cyclonic activity over the region (Wu and Polvani, 2017)."
AR6_WG1_10_23,10,59,"when compared with the pre-industrial period. Pluvial conditions at that time and a reduction in precipitation from the Last Glacial Maximum to the pre-industrial period are consistent with drying trends for the region in models with GHG concentrations exceeding pre-industrial levels. However, the dominant large-scale drivers responsible for the precipitation changes observed during these two transitions are markedly different: mainly ice-sheet retreat and increasing insolation on one hand, increasing GHGs on the other hand. This suggests that the Last Glacial Maximum correspondence is fortuitous which strongly limits its use to capture future hydrological cycle changes (Section 8.3.2.4.4; Morrill et al., 2018; Lowry and Morrill, 2019). Furthermore, the conclusion of the Last Glacial Maximum drying versus wetting seems to strongly depend on the physical property of interest, hydrologic or vegetation INDICATORs (Scheff et al., 2017). Droughts are characterized by deficits in total soil moisture content that can be caused by a combination of decreasing precipitation and warming temperature, which promotes greater evapotranspiration. Regional-scale attribution of the prevalence of south-western North America drought since 1980 then mostly focuses on the attribution of change in these two variables."
AR6_WG1_10_24,10,59,"A second possible causal factor is the role for ocean-forced or internal atmospheric circulation change. Analysis of observed and CMIP5-simulated precipitation INDICates that the drought prevalence since 1980 is linked to natural, internal variability in the climate system (Knutson and Zeng, 2018). Based on observations and ensembles of SST-driven atmospheric simulations, Seager and Hoerling (2014) suggested that robust tropical Pacific and tropical North Atlantic forcing drove an important fraction of annual mean precipitation and soil moisture changes and that early 21st century multi-year droughts could be attributed to natural decadal swings in tropical Pacific and North Atlantic SSTs. A cold state of the tropical Pacific would lead by well-established atmospheric teleconnections to anomalous high pressure across the North Pacific and southern North America, favouring a weaker jet stream and a diversion of the Pacific storm track away from"

Understanding the context, however, is not trivial and requires understanding of both the user and provider (Guido et al., 2020) if the information is to be robust, reliable and relevant (Giorgi, 2020).

AR6_WG1_10_34,10,79,"Because the primary rainfall mechanism is frontal rain, the most relevant large-scale drivers are those that affect cyclogenesis, frontogenesis and the mid-latitude westerlies’ latitudinal position and moisture supply. These drivers and, thus, the region’s rainfall are linked to the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO; Reason and Rouault, 2005) or Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the dominant monthly and interannual mode of Southern Hemisphere atmospheric variability, and a measure of the pressure gradient between mid- and high latitudes. (See Sections 3.3, 3.7, 4.3 and Annex IV.2.2 for more general discussion of the SAM.) While in the post-1930 period, the SAM displays a long-term positive trend, the Cape Town region’s rainfall does not, and only the post-1979 trends of rainfall and SAM are conceptually consistent. For example, a positive trend in the SAM is associated with a negative trend in rainfall (Section 10.6.2.5 and Figure 10.18). There is also good agreement between the seasonality of the SAM and rainfall trends in the post-1979 period: a drying trend appears strongly in December to February and March to May, but not in June to August and September to November (Wolski et al., 2021), and trends in the SAM have similar seasonal dependence (E.-P.

A multi-model CORDEX ensemble INDICates a robust signal of reduction of total annual rainfall in the future, although there is less agreement on how changes in rainfall occurrence may evolve in the region, such as through fewer consecutive rain days or longer dry spells (Abiodun et al., 2017; Maúre et al., 2018). For the end of the century under RCP8.5, Dosio et al. (2019) also found drying. Moreover, in their analysis, the drying is associated with an increase in the number of consecutive dry days and a reduction in number of rainy days. Their results are consistent with the driving global models for all the precipitation INDICES, and they are robust independent of the choice of the regional climate model (RCM) or global model.

AR6_WG1_11_2,11,24,"In the literature, an event is generally considered extreme if the value of a variable exceeds (or lies below) a threshold. The thresholds have been defined in different ways, leading to differences in the meaning of extremes that may share the same name. For example, two sets of metrics for the frequency of hot/warm days have been used in the literature. One set counts the number of days when maximum daily temperature is above a relative threshold defined as the 90th or higher percentile of maximum daily temperature for the calendar day over a base period. An event based on such a definition can occur at any time of the year, and the impact of such an event would differ depending on the season. The other set counts the number of days in which maximum daily temperature is above an absolute threshold such as 35°C, because exceeding this temperature can sometimes cause health impacts (however, these impacts may depend on location and whether ecosystems and the population are adapted to such temperatures). While both types of hot extreme INDICES have been used to analyse changes in the frequency of hot/warm events, they represent different events that occur at different times global warming. Also multivariate extremes at single locations in the current climate but the probability of occurrence of warming levels (Vogel et al., 2020a). Therefore, in order to estimate arising from extremes would occur, the spatial extent of extremes 11.3, 11.4, 11.7 and 11.8 highlight increasing evidence that tropical cyclones, and compound events such as dry/hot conditions heavy precipitation events, pose widespread threats to societies that the probability for some recent extreme events is so small in occur without human influence (Section 11.2.4).

AR6_WG1_11_3,11,25,"Extreme weather and climate events occur on time scales of hours (e.g., convective storms that produce heavy precipitation) to days (e.g., tropical cyclones, heatwaves), to seasons and years (e.g., droughts). A robust determination of long-term changes in these events can have different requirements for the spatial and temporal scales and sample size of the data. In general, it is more difficult to determine long-term changes for events of fairly large temporal duration, such as ‘megadroughts’ that last several years or longer (e.g., Ault et al., 2014), because of the limitations of the observational sample size. Literature that studies changes in extreme precipitation and temperature often uses INDICES representing specifics of extremes that are derived from daily precipitation and temperature values. Station-based INDICES would have the same issues as those for the mean climate regarding the quality, availability, and homogeneity of the data. For the purpose of constructing regional information and/ or for comparison with model outputs, such as model evaluation, and detection and attribution, these station-based INDICES are often interpolated onto regular grids. Two different approaches, involving two different orders of operation, have been used in producing such gridded datasets."
AR6_WG1_11_4,11,25,"In some cases, such as for the HadEX3 dataset (Dunn et al., 2020), INDICES of extremes are computed using time series directly derived from stations first, and are then gridded over the space. As the INDICES are computed at the station level, the gridded data products represent point estimates of the INDICES averaged over the spatial scale of the grid box. In other instances, daily values of station observations are first gridded (e.g., Contractor et al., 2020a), and the interpolated values can then be used to compute various INDICES. Depending on the station density, values for extremes computed from data gridded this way represent extremes of spatial scales anywhere from the size of the grid box to a point. In regions with high station density (e.g., North America, Europe), the gridded values are closer to extremes of area means and are thus more appropriate for comparisons with extremes estimated from climate model output, which is often considered"
AR6_WG1_11_5,11,25,"Extreme INDICES computed from various reanalysis data products have been used in some studies, but reanalysis extreme statistics have not been rigorously compared to observations (Donat et al., 2016a)."
AR6_WG1_11_6,11,25,"In general, changes in temperature extremes from various reanalyses were most consistent with gridded observations after about 1980, but larger differences were found during the pre-satellite era (Donat et al., 2014b). Overall, lower agreement across reanalysis datasets was found for extreme precipitation changes, although temporal and spatial correlations against observations were found to be still significant. In regions with sparse observations (e.g., Africa and parts of South America), there is generally less agreement for extreme precipitation between different reanalysis products, INDICating a consequence of the lack of an observational constraint in these regions (Donat et al., 2014b, 2016a). More recent reanalyses, such as ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020), seem to have improved over previous products, at least over some regions (e.g., Mahto and Mishra, 2019; Gleixner et al., 2020; Sheridan et al., 2020). Caution is needed when reanalysis data products are used to provide additional information about past changes in these extremes in regions where observations are generally lacking."

AR6_WG1_11_8,11,28,"Apart from the detection and attribution of trends in extremes, new approaches have been developed to answer the question of whether, and to what extent, external drivers have altered the probability and intensity of an individual extreme event (NASEM, 2016). In AR5, there was an emerging consensus that the role of external drivers of climate change in specific extreme weather events could be estimated and quantified in principle, but related assessments were still confined to particular case studies, often using a single model, and typically focusing on high-impact events with a clear attributable signal. However, since AR5, the attribution of extreme weather events has emerged as a growing field of climate research with an increasing body of literature (see series of supplements to the annual State of the Climate report (Peterson et al., 2012, 2013a; Herring et al., 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018), including the number of approaches to examining extreme events (described in Easterling et al., 2016; Otto, 2017; Stott et al., 2016)). A commonly used approach – often called the risk-based approach in the literature, and referred to here as the ‘probability-based approach’ – produces statements such as ‘anthropogenic climate change made this event type twice as likely’ or ‘anthropogenic climate change made this event 15% more intense’. This is done by estimating probability distributions of the INDEX characterizing the event in today’s climate, as well as in a counterfactual climate, and either comparing intensities for a given occurrence probability (e.g., 1-in-100-year event) or probabilities for a given magnitude (see FAQ 11.3). There are a number of different analytical methods encompassed in the probability-based approach, building on observations and statistical analyses (e.g., van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), optimal fingerprint methods (Sun et al., 2014), regional climate and weather forecast models (e.g., Schaller et al., 2016), global climate models (GCMs) (e.g., Lewis and Karoly, 2013), and large ensembles of atmosphere-only GCMs (e.g., Lott et al., 2013). A key component in any event attribution analysis is the level of conditioning on the state of the climate system.

AR6_WG1_11_10,11,36,"The SREX (IPCC, 2012) reported a very likely decrease in the number of cold days and nights and increase in the number of warm days and nights at the global scale. Confidence in trends was assessed as regionally variable (low to medium confidence) due to either a lack of observations or varying signals in sub-regions. Since SREX (IPCC, 2012) and AR5 (IPCC, 2014), many regional- scale studies have examined trends in temperature extremes using different metrics that are based on daily temperatures, such as the Commission for Climatology/World Climate Research Program/ Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology joint Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and INDICES (ETCCDI) INDICES (Dunn et al., 2020). The additional observational records, along with a stronger warming signal, show very clearly that changes observed at the time of AR5 (IPCC, 2014) continued, providing strengthened evidence of an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes. While the magnitude of the observed trends in temperature-related extremes varies depending on the region, spatial and temporal scales, and metric assessed, evidence of a warming effect is overwhelming, robust, and consistent. In particular, an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes is almost always associated with an increase in the hottest temperatures and in the number of heatwave days. It is also the case for changes (decreases) in cold extremes. For this reason, and to simplify the presentation, the phrase ‘increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes’ is used to represent, collectively, an increase in the magnitude of extreme day and/or night temperatures, in the number of warm days and/or nights, and in the number of heatwave days. Changes in cold extremes are assessed similarly."

The duration of heat extremes has also lengthened in some regions, for example, in southern China (Luo and Lau, 2016), but there is medium confidence of heat extremes increasing in frequency in South Asia (AlSarmi and Washington, 2014; Sheikh et al., 2015; Mazdiyasni et al., 2017; Zahid et al., 2017; Nasim et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2019; Sen Roy, 2019). Warming trends in daily temperature extremes INDICES have also been observed in central Asia (Hu et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2018), the Hindu Kush Himalaya (Sun et al., 2017), and South East Asia (Supari et al., 2017; Cheong et al., 2018). The intensity and frequency of cold spells in all Asian regions have been decreasing since the beginning of the 20th century (high confidence) (Sheikh et al., 2015; Donat et al., 2016a; Dong et al., 2018; van Oldenborgh et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_11_12,11,38,"The AR5 assessed that CMIP3 and CMIP5 models generally captured the observed spatial distributions of the mean state and that the inter-model range of simulated temperature extremes was similar to the spread estimated from different observational datasets; the models generally captured trends in the second half of the 20th century for INDICES of extreme temperature, although they tended to overestimate trends in hot extremes and underestimate trends in cold extremes (Flato et al., 2013). Post-AR5 studies on the CMIP5 models’ performance in simulating mean and changes in temperature extremes continue to support the AR5 assessment (Fischer and Knutti, 2014; Sillmann et al., 2014; Ringard et al., 2016; Borodina et al., 2017b; Donat et al., 2017; Di Luca et al., 2020b). Over Africa, the observed warming in temperature extremes is captured by CMIP5 models, although it is underestimated in Western and Central Africa (Sherwood et al., 2014; Diedhiou et al., 2018). Over East Asia, the CMIP5 ensemble performs well in reproducing the observed trend in temperature extremes averaged over China (Dong et al., 2015).

Chen et al., 2020; Di Luca et al., 2020a; Kim et al., 2020; Thorarinsdottir et al., 2020; Wehner et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021) INDICate that the CMIP6 models perform similarly to the CMIP5 models regarding biases in hot and cold extremes. In general, CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations are similar in their performance in simulating the observed climatology of extreme temperatures (high confidence). The general warm bias in hot extremes and cold bias in cold extremes reported for CMIP5 models (Kharin et al., 2013; Sillmann et al., 2013a) remain in CMIP6 models (Di Luca et al., 2020a). However, there is some evidence that"
AR6_WG1_11_14,11,39,"CMIP6 models better represent some of the underlying processes leading to extreme temperatures, such as seasonal and diurnal variability and synoptic-scale variability (Di Luca et al., 2020a). Whether these improvements are sufficient to enhance our understanding of past changes, or to reduce uncertainties in future projections, remains unclear. The relative error estimates in the simulation of various INDICES of temperature extremes in the available CMIP6 models show that no single model performs the best on all INDICES, and the multi-model ensemble seems to outperform any individual model due to its reduction in systematic bias (Kim et al., 2020). Figure 11.10 show errors in the 1979–2014 average annual TXx and annual TNn simulated by available CMIP6 models in comparison with HadEX3 and ERA5 (Kim et al., 2020; Wehner et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). While the magnitude of the model error depends on the reference dataset, the model evaluations drawn from different reference datasets are quite similar. In general, models reproduce the spatial patterns and magnitudes of both cold and hot temperature extremes quite well. There are also systematic biases. Hot extremes tend to be too cool in mountainous and high-latitude regions, but too warm in the eastern USA and South America. For cold extremes, CMIP6 models are too cool, except in north-eastern Eurasia and the southern mid-latitudes. Errors in seasonal mean temperatures are uncorrelated with errors in extreme temperatures and are often of opposite sign (Wehner et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_11_15,11,39,"Several regional climate models (RCMs) have also been evaluated in terms of their performance in simulating the climatology of extremes in various regions of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) (Giorgi et al., 2009), especially in East Asia (Ji and Kang, 2015; Yu et al., 2015; Park et al., 2016; Bucchignani et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017a; Niu et al., 2018; Y. Sun et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2019), Europe (Vautard et al., 2013, 2021; Smiatek et al., 2016; Gaertner et al., 2018; Cardoso et al., 2019; Lorenz et al., 2019; Jacob et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020), and Africa (J. Kim et al., 2014; Diallo et al., 2015; Dosio, 2017; Samouly et al., 2018; Mostafa et al., 2019). Compared to GCMs, RCM simulations show an added value in simulating temperature-related extremes, though this depends on topographical complexity and the parameters employed (see Section 10.3.3). The improvement with resolution is noted in East Asia (Park et al., 2016; W. Zhou et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2017; Hui et al., 2018). However, in the European CORDEX ensemble, different aerosol climatologies with various degrees of complexity were used in projections (Bartók et al., 2017; Lorenz et al., 2019) and the land surface models used in the RCMs do not account for physiological CO effects on photosynthesis leading to enhanced water-use efficiency and decreased evapotranspiration (Schwingshackl et al., 2019), which could lead to biases in the representation of temperature extremes in these projections (Boé et al., 2020). In addition, there are key cold biases in temperature extremes over areas with complex topography (Niu et al., 2018). Over North America, 12 RCMs were evaluated over the ARCTIC-CORDEX region (Diaconescu et al., 2018). Models performed well at simulating climate INDICES related to mean air temperature and hot extremes over most of the Canadian Arctic, with the exception of the Yukon region where models displayed the largest biases related to topographic effects. Two RCMs were evaluated against observed extremes INDICES over North America over the period 1989–2009, with a cool bias in minimum temperature"
AR6_WG1_11_16,11,40,"Some land forcings are not well represented in climate models. As highlighted in the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) Chapter 2, there is high agreement that temperate deforestation leads to summer warming and winter cooling (Anderson et al., 2011; Gálos et al., 2011, 2013; Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; Wickham et al., 2013; Zhao and Jackson, 2014; Ahlswede and Thomas, 2017; Bright et al., 2017; Strandberg and Kjellström, 2019), which has substantially contributed to the warming of hot extremes in the northern mid-latitudes over the course of the 20th century (Lejeune et al., 2018) and in recent years (Strandberg and Kjellström, 2019). However, observed forest effects on the seasonal and diurnal cycle of temperature are not well-captured in several ESMs: while observations show a cooling effect of forest cover compared to non-forest vegetation during daytime (Li et al., 2015), in particular in arid, temperate, and tropical regions (Alkama and Cescatti, 2016), several ESMs simulate a warming of daytime temperatures for regions with forest versus non- forest cover (Lejeune et al., 2017). Also irrigation effects, which can lead to regional cooling of temperature extremes, are generally not integrated in current generations of ESMs (Section 11.3.1). In summary, there is high confidence that climate models can reproduce the mean state and overall warming of temperature extremes observed globally and in most regions, although the magnitude of the trends may differ. The ability of models to capture observed trends in temperature-related extremes depends on the metric evaluated, the way INDICES are calculated, and the time periods and spatial scales considered. Regional climate models add value in simulating temperature-related extremes over GCMs in some regions. Some land forcings on temperature extremes are not well- captured (effects of deforestation) or generally not representated (irrigation) in ESMs."
AR6_WG1_11_17,11,40,"in the frequency or intensity of cold extremes to human influence, dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, on global and continental scales, and for many AR6 regions. These include attribution of changes in the magnitude of annual TXx, TNx, TXn, and TNn, based on different observational datasets including, HadEX2 and HadEX3, CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations, and different statistical methods (Kim et al., 2016; Z. Wang et al., 2017a; Seong et al., 2021). As is the case for an increase in mean temperature (Section 3.3.1), an increase in extreme temperature is mostly due to greenhouse gas forcing, offset by aerosol forcing. The aerosols’ cooling effect is clearly detectable over Europe and Asia (Seong et al., 2021). As much as 75% of the moderate daily hot extremes (above 99.9th percentile) over land are due to anthropogenic warming (Fischer and Knutti, 2015). New results are found to be more robust due to the extended period that improves the signal-to-noise ratio. The effect of anthropogenic forcing is clearly detectable and attributable in the observed changes in these INDICATORs of temperature extremes, even at country and sub-country scales, such as in Canada (Wan et al., 2019). Changes in the number of warm nights, warm days, cold nights, and cold days, and other INDICATORs such as the Warm Spell Duration INDEX (WSDI), are also attributed to anthropogenic influence (Christidis and Stott, 2016; Hu et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_11_18,11,40,"Regional studies, including for Asia (Dong et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018), Australia (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017), and Europe (Christidis and Stott, 2016), found similar results. A clear anthropogenic signal is also found in the trends in the Combined Extreme INDEX (CEI) for North America, Asia, Australia, and Europe (Dittus et al., 2016). While various studies have described increasing trends in several heatwave metrics (heatwave duration, the number of heatwave days, etc.) in different regions (e.g., Cowan et al., 2014; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2016; M. Sanderson et al., 2017), few recent studies have explicitly attributed these changes to causes; most of them stated that observed trends are consistent with anthropogenic warming. The detected anthropogenic signals are clearly separable from the response to natural forcing, and the results are generally insensitive to the use of different model samples, as well as different data availability, INDICating robust attribution. Studies of monthly, seasonal, and annual records in various regions (Kendon, 2014; Lewis and King, 2015; Bador et al., 2016; Meehl et al., 2016; C. Zhou et al., 2019) and globally (King, 2017) show an increase in the breaking of hot records and a decrease in the breaking of cold records (King, 2017). Changes in anthropogenically attributable record-breaking rates are noted to be largest over the Northern Hemisphere land areas (Shiogama et al., 2016). Yin and Sun (2018) found clear evidence of an anthropogenic signal in the changes in the number of frost and ice days, when multiple model simulations were used. In some key wheat-producing regions of Southern Australia, increases in frost days or frost season length have been reported (Dittus et al., 2014; Crimp et al., 2016); these changes are linked to decreases in rainfall, cloud-cover, and subtropical ridge strength, despite an overall increase in regional mean temperatures (Dittus et al., 2014; Pepler et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_11_19,11,41,"There have also been many extreme event attribution studies that examined short-duration temperature extremes, including daily temperatures, temperature INDICES, and heatwave metrics. Examples of these events from different regions are summarized in various annual Explaining Extreme Events supplements of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (Peterson et al., 2012, 2013a; Herring et al., 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020), including a number of approaches to examine extreme events (described in Easterling et al., 2016; Stott et al., 2016; Otto, 2017). Several studies of recent events from 2016 onwards have determined an infinite risk ratio (a fraction of attributable risk, or FAR, of 1), INDICating that the occurrence probability for such events is close to zero in model simulations without anthropogenic influences (see Herring et al., 2018, 2019, 2020; Imada et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2019). Though it is difficult to accurately estimate the lower bound of the uncertainty range of the FAR in these cases (Paciorek et al., 2018), the fact that those events are so far outside the envelop of the models with only natural forcing INDICates that it is extremely unlikely for those events to occur without human influence."
AR6_WG1_11_20,11,42,"Colour Low model agreement extremes will occur, even at the 1.5°C GWL (Figure 11.11). At this level, widespread significant changes at the grid-box level occur for different temperature INDICES (Aerenson et al., 2018). In agreement with CMIP5 projections, CMIP6 simulations show that a 0.5°C increment in global warming will significantly increase the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, and decrease the intensity and frequency of cold extremes on the global scale (Figures 11.6, 11.8 and 11.12). It takes less than half of a degree for the changes in TXx to emerge above the level of natural variability (Figure 11.8) and the 66% ranges of the land medians of the 10-year or 50-year TXx events do not overlap between 1.0°C and 1.5°C in the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble simulations (Figure 11.6, Li et al., 2021). Projected warming is larger for TNn and exhibits strong equator-to- pole amplification, similar to the warming of boreal winter mean temperatures. The warming of TXx is more uniform over land and does not exhibit this behaviour (Figure 11.11). The warming of temperature extremes on global and regional scales tends to scale linearly with global warming (Section 11.1.4; Fischer et al., 2014; Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021; see also SR1.5, Chapter 3). In the mid-latitudes, the rate of warming of hot extremes can be as large as twice the rate of global warming (Figure 11.11). In the Arctic winter, the rate of warming of the temperature of the coldest nights is about three times the rate of global warming (Appendix, Figure 11.A.1). Projected changes"

By the end of the century, these area fractions increase to 92% and 62%, respectively. Such nonlinearities in the characteristics of future regional extremes are shown, for instance, for Europe (Dosio and Fischer, 2018; Spinoni et al., 2018b; Lionello and Scarascia, 2020), Asia (Guo et al., 2017; Harrington and Otto, 2018b; King et al., 2018), and Australia (Lewis et al., 2017a) under various global warming thresholds. The nonlinear increase in fixed-threshold INDICES (e.g., based on a percentile for a given reference period, or on an absolute threshold) as a function of global warming is consistent with a linear warming of the absolute temperature of the temperature extremes (e.g., Whan et al., 2015). Compared to the historical climate, warming will result in strong increases in heatwave area, duration and magnitude (Vogel et al., 2020b). These changes are mostly due to the increase in mean seasonal temperature, rather than changes in temperature variability, though the latter can have an effect in some regions (Brown, 2020; Di Luca et al., 2020b; Suarez-Gutierrez et al., 2020a)."
AR6_WG1_11_22,11,44,"In Australasia (Table 11.10), evidence includes increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, such as warm days, warm nights, and heatwaves, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes, such as cold days and cold nights over the continent, as projected by CMIP5, CMIP6, and CORDEX simulations (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; Lewis et al., 2017a; Herold et al., 2018; Coppola et al., 2021b; Evans et al., 2021). Over most of Australia, increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes are projected to be predominantly driven by the long- term increase in mean temperatures (Di Luca et al., 2020b). Future projections INDICate a decrease in the number of frost days regardless of the region and season considered (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; Herold et al., 2018)."

Under RCP8.5, the number of heatwave days are projected to increase for the intra-Americas region for the end of the 21st century (Angeles-Malaspina et al., 2018). A general decrease in the frequency of cold spells and frost days is projected, as INDICated by several INDICES based on minimum temperature (López- Franca et al., 2016)."
AR6_WG1_11_24,11,46,"Overall, there is a lack of systematic analysis of long-term trends in sub-daily extreme precipitation at the global scale. Often, sub-daily precipitation data have only sporadic spatial coverage and are of limited length. Additionally, the available data records are far shorter than needed for a robust quantification of past changes in sub-daily extreme precipitation (C. Li et al., 2019a). Despite these limitations, there are studies in regions of almost all continents that generally INDICate intensification of sub-daily extreme precipitation, although there remains low confidence in an overall increase at the global scale. Studies include an increase in extreme sub-daily rainfall in summer over South Africa (Sen Roy and Rouault, 2013), annually in Australia (Guerreiro et al., 2018b), over 23 urban locations in India (Ali and Mishra, 2018), in Peninsular Malaysia (Syafrina et al., 2015), and in eastern China in the summer season during 1971–2013 (Xiao et al., 2016). In some regions in Italy (Arnone et al., 2013; Libertino et al., 2019) and in the USA during 1950–2011 (Barbero et al., 2017), there is also an increase. In general, an increase in sub-"
AR6_WG1_11_25,11,47,"In Central and South America (Table 11.14), evidence shows an increase in extreme precipitation, but in general there is low confidence; while continent-wide analyses produced wetting trends are not robust. Rx1day increased at more stations than it decreased in South America between 1950 and 2018 (Sun et al., 2021). Over the period 1950–2010, both Rx5day and R99p increased over large regions of South America, including North-Western South America, Northern South America, and South-Eastern South America (Skansi et al., 2013). There are large regional differences. A decrease in daily extreme precipitation is observed in north-eastern Brazil (Skansi et al., 2013; Bezerra et al., 2018; Dereczynski et al., 2020). Trends in extreme precipitation INDICES were not statistically significant over the period 1947–2012 within the São Francisco River basin in the Brazilian semi-arid region (Bezerra et al., 2018). An increase in extreme rainfall is observed in the Amazon with medium confidence (Skansi et al., 2013) and in South-Eastern South America with high confidence (Skansi et al., 2013; Valverde and Marengo, 2014; Barros et al., 2015; Ávila et al., 2016; Wu and Polvani, 2017; Lovino et al., 2018; Dereczynski et al., 2020). Among all sub-regions, South- Eastern South America shows the highest rate of increase for rainfall extremes, followed by the Amazon (Skansi et al., 2013). Increases in the intensity of heavy daily rainfall events have been observed in the southern Pacific and in the Titicaca basin (Skansi et al., 2013; Huerta and Lavado‐Casimiro, 2021). In Southern Central America, trends in annual precipitation are generally not significant, although small (but significant) increases are found in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama (Hidalgo et al., 2017). Small positive trends were found in multiple extreme precipitation INDICES over the Caribbean region over a short time period (1986–2010) (Stephenson et al., 2014; McLean et al., 2015)."
AR6_WG1_11_26,11,49,"Different generations of CMIP models have improved over time, though quite modestly (Flato et al., 2013; Watterson et al., 2014). Improvements in the representation of the magnitude of the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and INDICES (ETCCDI) in CMIP5 over CMIP3 (Sillmann et al., 2013a; Chen and Sun, 2015a) have been attributed to higher resolution, as higher-resolution models represent smaller areas at individual grid boxes. Additionally, the spatial distribution of extreme rainfall simulated by high-resolution"
AR6_WG1_11_27,11,50,"In general, there is high confidence that historical simulations by CMIP5 and CMIP6 models of similar horizontal resolutions are interchangeable in their performance in simulating the observed climatology of extreme precipitation. Studies using regional climate models (RCMs), for example, CORDEX (Giorgi et al., 2009) over Africa (Dosio et al., 2015; Klutse et al., 2016; Pinto et al., 2016; Gibba et al., 2019), Australia, East Asia (Park et al., 2016), Europe (Prein et al., 2016a; Fantini et al., 2018), and parts of North America (Diaconescu et al., 2018) suggest that extreme rainfall events are better captured in RCMs compared to their host GCMs due to their ability to address regional characteristics, for example, topography and coastlines. However, CORDEX simulations do not show good skill over South Asia for heavy precipitation, and do not add value with respect to their GCM source of boundary conditions (Mishra et al., 2014b; S. Singh et al., 2017). The evaluation of models in simulating regional processes is discussed in detail in Section 10.3.3.4. The high-resolution simulation of mid-latitude winter extreme precipitation over land is of similar magnitude to point observations. Simulation of summer extreme precipitation has a large bias when compared with observations at the same spatial scale. Simulated extreme precipitation in the tropics also appears to be too large, INDICating possible deficiencies in the parametrization of cumulus convection at this resolution. Indeed, precipitation distributions at both daily and sub-daily time scales are much improved with a convection-permitting model (Belušić et al., 2020) over Western Africa (Berthou et al., 2019b), East Africa (Finney et al., 2019), North America and Canada (Cannon and Innocenti, 2019; Innocenti et al., 2019) and over Belgium in Europe (Vanden Broucke et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_11_28,11,50,"Since AR5 there has been new and robust evidence and improved understanding of human influence on extreme precipitation. In particular, detection and attribution analyses have provided consistent and robust evidence of human influence on extreme precipitation of one- and five-day durations at global to continental scales. The observed increases in Rx1day and Rx5day over the Northern Hemisphere land area during 1951–2005 can be attributed to the effect of combined anthropogenic forcing, including greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols, as simulated by CMIP5 models and the rate of intensification with regard to warming is consistent with C-C scaling (Zhang et al., 2013). This is confirmed to be robust when an additional nine years of observational data and the CMIP6 model simulations were used (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2, Figure 1; Paik et al., 2020). The influence of greenhouse gases is attributed as the dominant contributor to the observed intensification. The global average of Rx1day in the observations is consistent with simulations by both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models under anthropogenic forcing, but not under natural forcing (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2, Figure 1). The observed increase in the fraction of annual total precipitation falling into the top fifth or top first percentiles of daily precipitation can also be attributed to human influence at the global scale (Dong et al., 2021). The CMIP5 models were able to capture the fraction of land experiencing a strong intensification of heavy precipitation during 1960–2010 under anthropogenic forcing, but not in unforced simulations (Fischer et al., 2014). But the models underestimated the observed trends (Borodina et al., 2017a). Human influence also significantly contributed to the historical changes in record-breaking one-day precipitation (Shiogama et al., 2016). There is also limited evidence of the influences of natural forcing. Substantial reductions in Rx5day and Simple Daily Intensity INDEX (SDII) for daily precipitation intensity over the global summer monsoon regions occurred during 1957–2000 after explosive volcanic eruptions (Paik and Min, 2018). The reduction in post-volcanic eruption extreme precipitation in the simulations is closely linked to the decrease in mean precipitation, for which both thermodynamic effects (moisture reduction due to surface cooling) and dynamic effects (monsoon circulation weakening) play important roles."
AR6_WG1_11_29,11,51,"Evidence of human influence on extreme precipitation at regional scales is more limited and less robust. In north-west Australia, the increase in extreme rainfall since 1950 can be related to increased monsoonal flow due to increased aerosol emissions, but cannot be attributed to an increase in greenhouse gases (Dey et al., 2019a). Anthropogenic influence on extreme precipitation in China was detected in one study (H. Li et al., 2017), but not in another using different detection and data-processing procedures (W. Li et al., 2018a), INDICating the lack of robustness in the detection results. A still weak signal-to-noise ratio seems to be the main cause for the lack of robustness, as detection would become robust 20 years in the future (W. Li et al., 2018a). Krishnan et al. (2016) attributed the observed increase in heavy rain events (intensity >100 mm day –1 ) in the post-1950s over central India to the combined effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols, land-use and land-cover changes, and rapid warming of the equatorial Indian Ocean SSTs. Roxy et al. (2017) and Devanand et al. (2019) showed that the increase in widespread extremes over the South Asian Monsoon during 1950–2015 is due to the combined impacts of the warming of the Western Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea) and the intensification of irrigation water management over India."
AR6_WG1_11_30,11,51,"Anthropogenic influence may have affected the large-scale meteorological processes necessary for extreme precipitation and the localized thermodynamic and dynamic processes, both contributing to changes in extreme precipitation events. Several new methods have been proposed to disentangle these effects by either conditioning on the circulation state or attributing analogues. In particular, the extremely wet winter of 2013–2014 in the UK can be attributed, approximately to the same degree, to both temperature- induced increases in saturation vapour pressure and changes in the large-scale circulation (Vautard et al., 2016; Yiou et al., 2017). There are multiple cases INDICating that very extreme precipitation may increase at a rate more than the C-C rate (7% per 1°C of warming) (Pall et al., 2017; Risser and Wehner, 2017; van der Wiel et al., 2017; van Oldenborgh et al., 2017; S.-Y.S. Wang et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_11_31,11,52,"methane (CH ), solar forcing, or sulphate (SO ) (Sillmann et al., 2019). In some models – CESM1 in particular – the extreme precipitation response to warming may follow a quadratic relation (Pendergrass et al., 2019). Figure 11.15 shows changes in the 10- and 50-year return values of Rx1day at different warming levels as simulated by the CMIP6 models. The median value of the scaling over land, across all Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and all models, is close to 7% per 1°C of warming for the 50-year return value of Rx1day. It is just slightly smaller for the 10- and 50-year return values of Rx5day (Li et al., 2021). The 90% ranges of the multimodel ensemble changes across all land grid boxes in the 50-year return values for Rx1day and Rx5day do not overlap between 1.5°C and 2°C warming levels (Li et al., 2021), INDICating that a small increment such as 0.5°C in global warming can result in a significant increase in extreme precipitation. Projected long-period Rx1day return value changes are larger than changes in mean Rx1day and with larger relative changes for more rare events (Pendergrass, 2018; Mizuta and Endo, 2020; Wehner, 2020). The rate of change of moderate extreme precipitation may depend more on the forcing agent, similar to the mean precipitation response to warming (Lin et al., 2016, 2018). Thus, there is high confidence that extreme precipitation that occurs once a year or less frequently increases proportionally to the amount of surface warming, and the rate of change in precipitation is not dependent on the underlying forcing agents of warming."
AR6_WG1_11_32,11,53,"there are regional differences, extreme precipitation is projected to increase in almost all sub-regions, though there can be spatial heterogeneity within sub-regions, such as in India (Shashikanth et al., 2018) and South East Asia (Ohba and Sugimoto, 2019). In East and South East Asia, there is high confidence that extreme precipitation is projected to intensify (Seo et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014; Y. Xu et al., 2016; Nayak et al., 2017; X. Wang et al., 2017; Y. Wang et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018; D. Li et al., 2018; Sui et al., 2018). Extreme daily precipitation is also projected to increase in South Asia (Xu et al., 2017; Han et al., 2018; Shashikanth et al., 2018). The extreme precipitation INDICES, including Rx5day, R95p, and days of heavy precipitation (i.e., R10mm), are all projected to increase under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios in central and northern Asia (Xu et al., 2017; Han et al., 2018). A general wetting across the whole Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas is projected, with increases in heavy precipitation in the 21st century (Palazzi et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014; Rajbhandari et al., 2015; R. Zhang et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2018; Paltan et al., 2018). Agreement in projected changes by different models is low in regions of complex topography such as Hindu-Kush Himalayas (Roy et al., 2019), but CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX-CORE simulations consistently project an increase in heavy precipitation in higher latitude areas, such as West and East Siberia, and Russian Far East (high confidence) (Coppola et al., 2021a)."
AR6_WG1_11_33,11,55,"In addition to the amount and intensity of precipitation, the main factors for river floods include antecedent soil moisture (Paschalis et al., 2014; Berghuijs et al., 2016; Grillakis et al., 2016; Woldemeskel and Sharma, 2016) and snow water-equivalent in cold regions (Sikorska et al., 2015; Berghuijs et al., 2016). Other factors are also important, including stream morphology (Borga et al., 2014; Slater et al., 2015), river and catchment engineering (Pisaniello et al., 2012; Nakayama and Shankman, 2013; Kim and Sanders, 2016), land-use and land-cover characteristics (Aich et al., 2016; Rogger et al., 2017) and changes (Knighton et al., 2019), and feedbacks between climate, soil, snow, vegetation, etc. (Hall et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2014; Berghuijs et al., 2016; Buttle et al., 2016; Teufel et al., 2019). Water regulation and management have, in general, increased resilience to flooding (Formetta and Feyen, 2019), masking effects of an increase in extreme precipitation on flood probability in some regions, even though they do not eliminate very extreme floods (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2017). This means that an increase in precipitation extremes may not always result in an increase in river floods (Sharma et al., 2018; Do et al., 2020). Yet, as very extreme precipitation can become a dominant factor for river floods, there can be some correspondence in the changes in very extreme precipitation and river floods (Ivancic and Shaw, 2015; Wasko and Sharma, 2017; Wasko and Nathan, 2019). This has been observed in the western Mediterranean (Llasat et al., 2016), in China (Q. Zhang et al., 2015a) and in the USA (Peterson et al., 2013b; Berghuijs et al., 2016; Slater and Villarini, 2016). In regions with a seasonal snow cover, snowmelt is the main cause of extreme river flooding over large areas (Pall et al., 2019). Extensive snowmelt combined with heavy and/or long-duration precipitation can cause significant floods (D. Li et al., 2019; Krug et al., 2020). Changes in floods in these regions can be uncertain because of the compounding and competing effects of the responses of snow and rain to warming that affect snowpack size: warming results in an increase in precipitation, but also a reduction in the time period of snowfall accumulation (Teufel et al., 2019). An increase in atmospheric CO enhances water-use efficiency by plants (Roderick et al., 2015; Milly and Dunne, 2016; Swann et al., 2016; Swann, 2018); this could reduce evapotranspiration and contribute to the maintenance of soil moisture and streamflow levels under enhanced atmospheric CO concentrations (Yang et al., 2019). This mechanism would suggest an increase in the magnitude of some floods in the future (Kooperman et al., 2018). But this effect is uncertain as an increase in leaf area INDEX, and vegetation coverage could also result in overall larger water consumption (Mátyás and Sun, 2014; Mankin et al., 2019; Teuling et al., 2019), and there are also other CO -related mechanisms that come into play (Cross-Chapter Box 5.1). Various factors, such as extreme precipitation (Cho et al., 2016; Archer and Fowler, 2018), glacier lake outbursts (Schneider et al., 2014; Schwanghart et al., 2016), or dam breaks (Biscarini et al., 2016) can cause flash floods. Very intense rainfall, along with a high fraction of impervious surfaces can result in flash floods in urban areas (Hettiarachchi et al., 2018). Because of this direct connection, changes in very intense precipitation can translate to changes in urban flood potential (Rosenzweig et al., 2018), though there can be a spectrum of urban flood responses to this flood potential (Smith et al., 2013), as many factors, such as the overland flow rate and the design of urban (Falconer et al., 2009) and storm water drainage systems (Maksimović et al., 2009), can play an important role. Nevertheless, changes in extreme precipitation are the main proxy for inferring changes in some types of flash floods, (which are addressed in Section 12.4), given the relation between extreme precipitation and pluvial floods, the very limited literature on urban and pluvial floods (e.g., Skougaard Kaspersen et al., 2017), and limitations of existing methodologies for assessing changes in floods (Archer et al., 2016)."
AR6_WG1_11_34,11,58,"Droughts refer to periods of time with substantially below- average moisture conditions, usually covering large areas, during which limitations in water availability result in negative impacts for various components of natural systems and economic sectors (Wilhite and Pulwarty, 2017; Ault, 2020). Depending on the variables used to characterize it and the systems or sectors being impacted, drought may be classified in different types (Figure 8.6 and Appendix Table 11.A.1) such as meteorological (precipitation deficits), agricultural (e.g., crop yield reductions or failure, often related to soil moisture deficits), ecological (related to plant water stress that causes e.g., tree mortality), or hydrological droughts (e.g., water shortage in streams or storages such as reservoirs, lakes, lagoons, and groundwater; see Glossary). The distinction of drought types is not absolute, as drought can affect different sub- domains of the Earth system concomitantly, but sometimes also asynchronously, including propagation from one drought type to another (Brunner and Tallaksen, 2019). Because of this, drought cannot be characterized using a single universal definition (Lloyd- Hughes, 2014) or directly measured based on a single variable (SREX Chapter 3; Wilhite and Pulwarty, 2017). Drought can happen on a wide range of timescales – from ‘flash droughts’ on a scale of weeks, and characterized by a sudden onset and rapid intensification of drought conditions (Hunt et al., 2014; Otkin et al., 2018; Pendergrass et al., 2020) to multi-year or decadal rainfall deficits – sometimes termed ‘megadroughts’ (see Glossary; Ault et al., 2014; Cook et al., 2016b; Garreaud et al., 2017). Droughts are often analysed using INDICES that are measures of drought severity, duration and frequency (Sections 8.3.1.6, 8.4.1.6, 12.3.2.6 and 12.3.2.7, and Table 11.A.1). There are many drought INDICES published in the scientific literature, as also highlighted in SREX (SREX Chapter 3). These can range from anomalies in single variables (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, evapotranspiration) to INDICES combining different atmospheric variables."
AR6_WG1_11_35,11,58,"This assessment is focused on changes in physical conditions and metrics of direct relevance to droughts: (i) precipitation deficits; (ii) excess of atmospheric evaporative demand (AED); (iii) soil moisture deficits; (iv) hydrological deficits; and e) atmospheric- based INDICES combining precipitation and AED (Table 11.A.1). In the regional tables (Section 11.9), the assessment is structured by drought types, addressing: (i) meteorological, (ii) agricultural and ecological, and (iii) hydrological droughts. Note that the latter two assessments directly inform the Chapter 12 assessment on projected regional changes in these climatic impact-drivers (Section 12.4). The text refers to AR6 region acronyms (Section 11.9, and see Section 1.4.5)."
AR6_WG1_11_36,11,59,"Atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) quantifies the maximum amount of actual evapotranspiration (ET) that can happen from land surfaces if they are not limited by water availability (Table 11.A.1). AED is affected by radiative and aerodynamic components. For this reason, the atmospheric dryness, often quantified with the relative humidity or the vapour pressure deficit (VPD), is not equivalent to the AED, as other variables are also highly relevant, including solar radiation and wind speed (Hobbins et al., 2012; McVicar et al., 2012a; Sheffield et al., 2012). AED can be estimated using different methods (McMahon et al., 2013), and those solely based on air temperature (e.g., Hargreaves, Thornthwaite) usually overestimate it in terms of magnitude and temporal trends (Sheffield et al., 2012), in particular, in the context of substantial background warming. Physically-based combination methods such as the Penman-Monteith equation are more adequate and recommended since 1998 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Oganization (Pereira et al., 2015). For this reason, the assessment of this Chapter, when considering atmospheric- based drought INDICES, only includes AED estimates using the latter (see also Section 11.9). AED is generally higher than ET, since AED represents an upper bound for ET. Hence, an AED increase does not necessarily lead to increased ET (Milly and Dunne, 2016), in particular under drought conditions given soil moisture limitation (Bonan et al., 2014; Berg et al., 2016; Konings et al., 2017; Stocker et al., 2018). In general, AED is highest in regions where ET is lowest (e.g., desert areas), further illustrating the decoupling between the two variables under limited soil moisture."
AR6_WG1_11_37,11,60,11.6.1.5 Atmospheric-based Drought INDICES
AR6_WG1_11_38,11,60,"Given the difficulties of drought quantification and data constraints, atmospheric-based drought INDICES combining both precipitation and AED have been developed, as they can be derived from meteorological data that is available in most regions (with few"
AR6_WG1_11_39,11,60,"exceptions). These demand/supply INDICES are not intended to be metrics of soil moisture, streamflow or vegetation water stress. Because of their reliance on precipitation and AED, they are mostly related to the actual water balance in humid regions, in which ET is not limited by soil moisture and tends towards AED. In water-limited regions and in dry periods everywhere, they constitute an upper bound for overall water-balance deficits (e.g., of surface waters) but are also related to conditions conducive to vegetation stress, particularly under soil moisture limitation (Section 11.6.1.2)."
AR6_WG1_11_40,11,60,"Although there are many atmospheric-based drought INDICES, two are assessed in this chapter: the Palmer Drought Severity INDEX (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration INDEX (SPEI). The PDSI has been widely used to monitor and quantify drought severity (Dai et al., 2018), but is affected by some constraints (SREX Chapter 3; Mukherjee et al., 2018a). Although the calculation of the PDSI is based on a soil water budget, the PDSI is essentially a climate drought INDEX that mostly responds to the precipitation and the AED (van der Schrier et al., 2013; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2018). The SPEI also combines precipitation and AED, being equally sensitive to these two variables (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2015). The SPEI is more sensitive to AED than the PDSI (Cook et al., 2014a; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2015), although under humid and normal precipitation conditions, the effects of AED on the SPEI are small (Tomas-Burguera et al., 2020). Given the limitations associated with temperature-based AED estimates (Section 11.6.1.2), only studies using the Penman-Monteith-based SPEI and PDSI (hereafter SPEI-PM and PDSI-PM) are considered in this assessment and in the regional tables in Section 11.9."
AR6_WG1_11_41,11,60,"This Chapter assesses changes in meteorological drought, agricultural and ecological droughts, and hydrological droughts. Precipitation-based INDICES are used for the estimation of changes in meteorological droughts, such as the Standardized Precipitation INDEX (SPI) and the number of consecutive dry days (CDD). Changes in total soil moisture and soil moisture-based drought events are used for the estimation of changes in agricultural and ecological droughts, complemented by changes in surface soil moisture, water- balance estimates (precipitation minus ET), and SPEI-PM and PDSI- PM. For hydrological droughts, changes in low flows are assessed, sometimes complemented by changes in mean streamflow."
AR6_WG1_11_42,11,61,"estimates provide an INDICation of possible trends in the influence of AED on drought. Given the observed global temperature increases (Sections 2.3.1.1 and 11.3) and dominant decrease in relative humidity over land areas (Simmons et al., 2010; Willett et al., 2014), VPD has increased globally (Barkhordarian et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2019). Pan evaporation has increased as a consequence of VPD changes in several AR6 regions, such as East Asia (Li et al., 2013; Z. Sun et al., 2018; M.-Z. Yang et al., 2018), Western and Central Europe (Mozny et al., 2020), the Mediterranean, (Azorin-Molina et al., 2015) and Central and Southern Australia (Stephens et al., 2018). Nevertheless, there is an important regional variability in observed trends, and in other AR6 regions pan evaporation has decreased – for example, in North Central America (Breña-Naranjo et al., 2017) and in the Tibetan Plateau (C. Zhang et al., 2018)). Physical models also show an important regional diversity, with an increase in New Zealand (Salinger and Porteous, 2014) and the Mediterranean (Gocic and Trajkovic, 2014; Azorin-Molina et al., 2015; Piticar et al., 2016), a decrease in South Asia (Jhajharia et al., 2015), and strong spatial variability in North America (Seager et al., 2015b). This variability is driven by the role of other meteorological variables affecting AED. Changes in solar radiation as a consequence of solar dimming and brightening may affect trends (Section 7.2.2.2; Kambezidis et al., 2012; Wang and Yang, 2014; Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2015). Wind speed is also relevant (McVicar et al., 2012b), and studies suggest a reduction of the wind speed in some regions (Z. Zhang et al., 2019b) that could compensate the role of the VPD increase. Nevertheless, the VPD trend seems to dominate the overall AED trends, compared to the effects of trends in wind speed and solar radiation (Wang et al., 2012; Park Williams et al., 2017; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a)."

A number of regional studies based on these drought INDICES have also shown stronger drying trends in comparison to trends in precipitation-based INDICES in the following AR6 regions (see also Section 11.9): NSA (R. Fu et al., 2013; Marengo and Espinoza, 2016), SCA (Hidalgo et al., 2017), WCA (Tabari and Aghajanloo, 2013; Sharafati et al., 2020), SAS (Niranjan Kumar et al., 2013), NEAF (Zeleke et al., 2017), WSAF (Edossa et al., 2016), NWN and NEN (Bonsal et al., 2013), EAS (Yu et al., 2014; Chen and Sun, 2015b; L.

There are stronger signals INDICating observed increases in agricultural and ecological drought (Section 11.9), which highlights the role of increased ET, driven by increased AED, for these trends (Sections 11.6.2.3 and11.6.2.5). Past increases in agricultural and ecological droughts are found on all continents and several regions (WAF, CAF, WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, SAU, MED, WCE, NES: medium confidence), while decreases are found only in one AR6 region (NAU: medium confidence). The more limited availability of datasets makes it more difficult to assess historical trends in hydrological drought at regional scale (Section 11.9). Increasing (MED: high confidence; WAF, EAS, SAU: medium confidence) and decreasing (NEU, SES: medium confidence) trends in hydrological droughts have only been observed in a few regions."

AR6_WG1_11_48,11,64,"A number of studies have analysed the ability of models to capture drought severity and trends based on climatic drought INDICES. Given the limitations of ESMs in reproducing the dynamic of precipitation deficits and AED (11.6.3.1, 11.6.3.2), atmospheric-based drought INDICES derived from ESM data for these two variables are also affected by uncertainties and biases. A comparison of historical trends in PDSI-PM for 1950–2014 derived from CMIP3 and CMIP5, with respective estimates derived from observations (Dai and Zhao, 2017) show a similar behaviour at global scale (long-term decrease), but low spatial agreement in the trends except in a few regions (Mediterranean, South Asia, north-western USA). In future projections, there is an important spread in PDSI-PM and SPEI-PM among different models (Cook et al., 2014a)."
AR6_WG1_11_49,11,66,11.6.4.4 Atmospheric-based Drought INDICES
AR6_WG1_11_50,11,66,"Different studies using atmospheric-based drought INDICES suggest an attributable anthropogenic signal, characterized by the increased frequency and severity of droughts (Cook et al., 2018), associated to increased AED (Section 11.6.4.2). The majority of studies are based on the PDSI-PM. Williams et al. (2015) and Griffin and Anchukaitis (2014) concluded that increased AED has had an increased contribution to drought severity over the last decades, and played a dominant role in the intensification of the 2012–2014 drought in California. The same temporal pattern and physical mechanism was stressed by Z. Li et al. (2017) in central Asia. Marvel et al. (2019) compared tree ring-based reconstructions of the PDSI-PM over the past millennium with PDSI- PM estimates based on output from CMIP5 models. The comparisons suggested a contribution of greenhouse gas forcing to the changes since the beginning of the 20th century, although characterized with temporal differences that could be driven by temporal variations in the aerosol forcing. This was in agreement with the dominant external forcings of aridification at global scale between 1950 and 2014 (Bonfils et al., 2020). In the Mediterranean region, there is medium confidence of drying attributable to antropogenic forcing as a consequence of the strong AED increase (Gocic and Trajkovic, 2014; Azorin-Molina et al., 2015; Liuzzo et al., 2016; Maček et al., 2018), which has enhanced the severity of drought events (Vicente- Serrano et al., 2014; Stagge et al., 2017; González-Hidalgo et al.,"
AR6_WG1_11_51,11,70,"Regions dependent on mountainous snowpack as a temporary reservoir may be affected by severe hydrological droughts in a warmer world. In the southern European Alps, both winter and summer low flows are projected to be more severe, with a 25% decrease in the 2050s (Vidal et al., 2016). In western USA, a 22% reduction in winter snow water equivalent is projected at around 2°C of global warming, with a further decrease of a 70% reduction at 4°C global warming (Rhoades et al., 2018). This decline would cause less predictable hydrological droughts in snowmelt-dominated areas of North America (Livneh and Badger, 2020). The exact magnitude of the influence of higher temperatures on snow-related droughts is, however, difficult to estimate (Mote et al., 2016), since the streamflow changes could affect the timing of peak streamflows but not necessarily their magnitude. In addition, projected changes in hydrological droughts downstream of declining glaciers can be very complex to assess (Chapter 9, see also SROCC). 11.6.5.5 Atmospheric-based Drought INDICES Studies show a stronger drying in projections based on atmospheric- based drought INDICES compared to ESM projections of changes in soil moisture (Berg and Sheffield, 2018) and runoff (Yang et al., 2019). It has been suggested that this difference is due to physiological CO effects (Section 11.6.5.2; Roderick et al., 2015; Milly and Dunne, 2016; Swann et al., 2016; Lemordant et al., 2018; Scheff, 2018; Swann, 2018; Greve et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). Nonetheless, there is evidence that differences in projections between atmospheric- based drought INDICES and water-balance metrics from ESMs are not alone due to CO -plant effects (Berg et al., 2016; Scheff et al., 2021). Differences can also be related to the fact that AED is an upper bound for ET in dry regions and conditions (Section 11.6.1.2) and that soil moisture stress limits increases in ET in projections (Section 11.6.5.2; Berg et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2021). In general, atmospheric-based INDICES show more drying than total column soil moisture (Berg and Sheffield, 2018; Cook et al., 2020; Scheff et al., 2021), but are more consistent with projected increases in surface soil moisture deficits (Dirmeyer et al., 2013; Dai et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019; Cook et al., 2020; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020c)."
AR6_WG1_11_52,11,70,"Atmospheric-based drought INDICES are not metrics of soil moisture or runoff (Section 11.6.1.5) so their projections may not necessarily reflect the same trend of online simulated soil moisture and runoff. Independently of effects on the land water balance, atmospheric- based drought INDICES will reflect the potential vegetation stress resulting from deficits between available water and enhanced AED, even in conditions with no or low ET. Under dry conditions, the enhanced AED associated with human forcing would increase plant water stress (Brodribb et al., 2020), with effects on widespread forest dieback and mortality (Anderegg et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2015; McDowell and Allen, 2015; McDowell et al., 2016, 2020), and stronger risk of megafires (Flannigan et al., 2016; Podschwit et al., 2018; Clarke and Evans, 2019; Varela et al., 2019). For these reasons, there is high confidence that the future projections of enhanced drought severity showed by the PDSI-PM and the SPEI- PM are representative of more frequent and severe plant stress episodes and more severe agricultural and ecological drought impacts in some regions."

Some regions are also projected to be affected by more severe agricultural and ecological droughts at 1.5°C (MED, WSAF, ESAF, SAU, NSA, SAM, SSA, can; medium confidence) At 4°C of global warming, even more regions would be affected by agricultural and ecological droughts (WCE, MED, CAU, EAU, SAU, WCA, EAS, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, CNA, ENA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF and MDG). NEAF, SAS are also projected to experience less agricultural and ecological drought with global warming (medium confidence). Projected changes in meteorological droughts are, overall, less extended but also affect several AR6 regions, at 1.5°C and 2°C (MED, EAU, SAU, SCA, NSA, NCA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG) and 4°C of global warming (WCE, MED, EAU, SAU, SEA, SCA, CAR, NWS, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, ENA, WAF, WSAF, ESAF, MDG).

AR6_WG1_11_55,11,73,"Identifying past trends in TC metrics remains a challenge due to the heterogeneous character of the historical instrumental data, which are known as ‘best-track’ data (Schreck et al., 2014). There is low confidence in most reported long-term (multi-decadal to centennial) trends in TC frequency- or intensity-based metrics due to changes in the technology used to collect the best-track data. This should not be interpreted as implying that no physical (real) trends exist, but rather as INDICating that either the quality or the temporal length of the data is not adequate to provide robust trend detection statements, particularly in the presence of multi-decadal variability. There are previous and ongoing efforts to homogenize the best-track data (Elsner et al., 2008; Kossin et al., 2013, 2020; Choy et al., 2015; Landsea, 2015; Emanuel et al., 2018) and there is substantial literature that finds positive trends in intensity-related metrics in the best-track during the ‘satellite period’, which is generally limited to around the past 40 years (Kang and Elsner, 2012; Kishtawal et al., 2012; Kossin et al., 2013, 2020; Mei and Xie, 2016; Zhao et al., 2018; Tauvale and Tsuboki, 2019). When best-track trends are tested using homogenized data, the intensity trends generally remain positive, but are smaller in amplitude (Kossin et al., 2013; Holland and Bruyère, 2014). Kossin et al. (2020) extended the homogenized TC intensity record to the period 1979–2017 and identified significant global increases in major TC exceedance probability of about 6% per decade. In addition to trends in TC intensity, there is evidence that TC intensification rates and the frequency of rapid intensification events have increased within the satellite era (Kishtawal et al., 2012; Balaguru et al., 2018; Bhatia et al., 2018). The increase in intensification rates is found in the best-track and the homogenized intensity data. A subset of the best-track data corresponding to hurricanes that have directly impacted the USA since 1900 is considered to be reliable, and shows no trend in the frequency of USA landfall events (Knutson et al., 2019). However, an increasing trend in normalized USA hurricane damage, which accounts for temporal changes in exposed wealth (Grinsted et al., 2019), and a decreasing trend in TC translation speed over the USA (Kossin, 2019) have also been identified in this"
AR6_WG1_11_56,11,76,"Operational forecasting models also reproduce TCs, and their use for climate projection studies shows promise. However, there is limited application for future projections as they are specifically developed for operational purposes, and TC climatology is not necessarily well evaluated. Intercomparison of operational models INDICates that enhancement of horizontal resolution can provide more credible projections of TCs (Nakano et al., 2017). Likewise, high-resolution climate models show promise as TC forecast tools (Zarzycki and Jablonowski, 2015; Reed et al., 2020), further narrowing the continuum of weather and climate models, and increasing confidence in projections of future TC behaviour. However, higher horizontal resolution does not necessarily lead to an improved TC climatology (Camargo et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_11_57,11,76,"There is general agreement in the literature that anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have measurably affected observed oceanic and atmospheric variability in TC-prone regions (see Chapter 3). This underpinned the SROCC assessment of medium confidence that humans have contributed to the observed increase in Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s (Chapter 5, Bindoff et al., 2013). Literature subsequent to AR5 lends further support to this statement (Knutson et al., 2019). However, there is still no consensus on the relative magnitude of human and natural influences on past changes in Atlantic hurricane activity, and particularly on which factor has dominated the observed increase (Ting et al., 2015) and it remains uncertain whether past changes in Atlantic TC activity are outside the range of natural variability. A recent result using high-resolution dynamical model experiments suggested that the observed spatial contrast in TC trends cannot be explained only by multi-decadal natural variability, and that external forcing plays an important role (Murakami et al., 2020). Observational evidence for significant global increases in the proportion of major TC intensities (Kossin et al., 2020) is consistent with both theory and numerical modelling simulations, which generally INDICate an increase in mean TC peak intensity and the proportion of very intense TCs in a warming world (Knutson et al., 2015, 2020; Walsh et al., 2015, 2016). In addition, high-resolution coupled model simulations provide support that natural variability alone is unlikely to explain the magnitude of the observed increase in TC intensification rates and upward TC intensity trend in the Atlantic basin since the early 1980s (Bhatia et al., 2019; Murakami et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_11_58,11,78,"A summary of studies on TC projections for the late 21st century, particularly studies since AR5, is given by Knutson et al. (2020), which is an assessment report mandated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Studies subsequent to Knutson et al. (2020) are generally consistent, and the confidence assessments here closely follow theirs (Cha et al., 2020), although there are some differences due to the varying confidence calibrations between the IPCC and WMO reports. There is not an established theory for the drivers of future changes in the frequency of TCs. Most, but not all, high-resolution global simulations project significant reductions in the total number of TCs, with the bulk of the reduction at the weaker end of the intensity spectrum as the climate warms (Knutson et al., 2020). Recent exceptions based on high-resolution coupled model results are noted in Bhatia et al. (2018) and Vecchi et al. (2019). Vecchi et al. (2019) showed that the representation of synoptic-scale seeds for TC genesis in their high-resolution model causes different projections of global TC frequency, and there is evidence for a decrease in cyclone seeds in some projected TC simulations (Sugi et al., 2020; Yamada et al., 2011). However, other research INDICates that TC seeds are not an independent control on climatological TC frequency, rather the seeds covary with the large-scale controls on TCs (Patricola et al., 2018). While empirical genesis INDICES derived from observations and reanalysis describe well the observed subseasonal and interannual variability of current TC frequency (Camargo et al., 2007, 2009; Tippett et al., 2011; Menkes et al., 2012), they fail to predict the decreased TC frequency found in most high-resolution model simulations (Zhang et al., 2010; Camargo, 2013; Wehner et al., 2015), as they generally project an increase as the climate warms. This suggests a limitation of the use of the empirical genesis INDICES for projections of TC genesis, in particular due to their sensitivity to the humidity variable considered in the genesis INDEX for these projections (Camargo et al., 2014). In a different approach, a statistical–dynamical downscaling framework assuming a constant seeding rate with warming (Emanuel, 2013, 2021) exhibits increases in TC frequency consistent with genesis INDICES-based projections, while downscaling with a different model leads to two different scenarios depending on the humidity variable considered (C.-Y. Lee et al., 2020). This disparity in the sign of the projected change in global TC frequency, and the difficulty in explaining the mechanisms behind the different signed responses, further emphasize the lack of process understanding of future changes in tropical cyclogenesis (Walsh et al., 2015; Hoogewind et al., 2020). Even within a single model, uncertainty in the pattern of future SST changes leads to large uncertainties (including the sign) in the projected change in TC frequency in individual ocean basins, although global TCs would appear to be less sensitive (Yoshida et al., 2017; Bacmeister et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_11_59,11,78,"Changes in SST and atmospheric temperature and moisture play a role in tropical cyclogenesis (Walsh et al., 2015). Reductions in vertical convective mass flux due to increased tropical stability have been associated with a reduction in cyclogenesis (Held and Zhao, 2011; Sugi et al., 2012). Satoh et al. (2015) further posit that the robust simulated increase in the number of intense TCs, and hence increased vertical mass flux associated with intense TCs, must lead to a decrease in overall TC frequency because of this association. The Genesis Potential INDEX can be modified to mimic the TC frequency decreases of a model by altering the treatment of humidity (Camargo et al., 2014). This supports the idea that increased mid-tropospheric saturation deficit (Emanuel et al., 2008) controls TC frequency, but the approach remains empirical. Other possible controlling factors, such as a decline in the number of seeds (held constant in Emanuel’s downscaling approach, or dependent on the genesis INDEX formulation in the approach proposed by C.-Y. Lee et al., 2020) caused by increased atmospheric stability have been proposed, but questioned as an important factor (Patricola et al., 2018). The resolution of atmospheric models affects the number of seeds, hence TC genesis frequency (Vecchi et al., 2019; Sugi et al., 2020; Yamada et al., 2021). The diverse and sometimes inconsistent projected changes in global TC frequency by high-resolution models INDICate that better process understanding and improvement of the models are needed to raise confidence in these changes."
AR6_WG1_11_60,11,79,"The increase in global TC maximum surface wind speeds is about 5% for a 2°C global warming across a number of high-resolution multi- decadal studies (Knutson et al., 2020). This INDICates the deepening in global TC minimum surface pressure under the global warming conditions. A regional cloud-permitting model study shows that the strongest TC in the western North Pacific can be as strong as 857 hPa in minimum surface pressure with a wind speed of 88 m s –1 under warming conditions in 2074–2087 (Tsuboki et al., 2015). TCs are also measured by quantities such as ACE and the power dissipation INDEX (PDI), which conflate TC intensity, frequency, and duration (Murakami et al., 2014). Several TC modelling studies (Yamada et al., 2010; H.S. Kim et al., 2014; Knutson et al., 2015) project little change or decreases in the globally accumulated value of PDI or ACE, which is due to the decrease in the total number of TCs."
AR6_WG1_11_61,11,79,"A projected increase in global average TC rain rates of about 12% for a 2°C global warming is consistent with the Clausius–Clapeyron scaling of saturation-specific humidity (Knutson et al., 2020). Increases substantially greater than Clausius–Clapeyron scaling are projected in some regions, which is caused by increased low-level moisture convergence due to projected TC intensity increases in those regions (Knutson et al., 2015; Phibbs and Toumi, 2016; Patricola and Wehner, 2018; M. Liu et al., 2019a). Projections of TC precipitation using large-ensemble experiments (Kitoh and Endo, 2019) show that the annual maximum one-day precipitation total is projected to increase, except for the western North Pacific where only a small change (or even a reduction) is projected, mainly due to a projected decrease of TC frequency. They also show that the 10-year return value of extreme Rx1day associated with TCs will greatly increase in a region extending from Hawaii to the south of Japan. TC tracks and the location of topography relative to TCs significantly affect precipitation, thus, in general, areas on the eastern and southern faces of mountains have more impacts of TC precipitation changes (Hatsuzuka et al., 2020). Projection studies using variable-resolution models in the North Atlantic (Stansfield et al., 2020) INDICate that TC- related precipitation rates within North Atlantic TCs and the amount of hourly precipitation due to TC are projected to increase by the end of the century compared to a historical simulation. However, the annual average TC-related Rx5day over the eastern USA is projected to decrease because of a reduction in landfalling TCs. RCM studies with around 25–50 km grid spacing are used to study projected changes in TCs. The projected changes of TCs in South East Asia simulated by RCMs are consistent with those of most GCMs, showing a decrease in TC frequency and an increase in the amount of TC- associated precipitation or an increase in the frequency of intense TCs (Redmond et al., 2015; Gallo et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_11_62,11,79,"The spatial extent, or ‘size’, of the TC wind field is an important determinant of storm surge and damage. No detectable anthropogenic influences on TC size have been identified to date, because TCs in observations vary in size substantially (Chan and Chan, 2015) and there is no definite theory on what controls TC size, although this is an area of active research (Chavas and Emanuel, 2014; Chan and Chan, 2018). However, projections by high-resolution models INDICate future broadening of TC wind fields when compared to TCs of the same categories (Yamada et al., 2017), while Knutson et al. (2015) simulate a reasonable interbasin distribution of TC size climatology, but project no statistically significant change in global average TC size. A plausible mechanism is that, as the tropopause height becomes higher with global warming, the eye wall areas become wider because the eye walls are inclined outward with height to the tropopause. This effect is only reproduced in high- resolution convection-permitting models capturing eye walls, and such modelling studies are not common. Moreover, the projected TC size changes are generally on the order of 10% or less, and these size changes are still highly variable between basins and studies. Thus, the projected change in both magnitude and sign of TC size is uncertain."
AR6_WG1_11_63,11,80,"tracks, but concluded that the overall effect due to the rising sea levels would increase the flood hazard. Future projection studies of storm surge in East Asia, including China, Japan and Korea, also INDICate that storm surges due to TCs become more severe (J.A. Yang et al., 2018; Mori et al., 2019, 2021; J. Chen et al., 2020b). For the Pacific Islands, McInnes et al. (2014) found that the future projected increase in storm surge in Fiji is dominated by sea level rise, and projected TC changes make only a minor contribution. Among various storm surge factors, there is high confidence that sea level rise will lead to a higher possibility of extreme coastal water levels in most regions, with all other factors assumed equal."
AR6_WG1_11_64,11,83,"Observed trends in severe convective storms or MCSs are not well documented, but the climatology of MCSs has been analysed in specific regions (North America, South America, Europe, Asia; regional aspects of convective storms are separately assessed in Chapter 12). As the definition of severe convective storms varies depending on the literature, it is not straightforward to make a synthesizing view of observed trends in severe convective storms in different regions. However, analysis using satellite observations provides a global view of MCSs (Kossin et al., 2017). The global distribution of thunderstorms is captured (Zipser et al., 2006; Liu and Zipser, 2015) by using the satellite precipitation measurements by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) (Hou et al., 2014). The climatological characteristics of MCSs are provided by satellite analyses in South America (Durkee and Mote, 2010; Rasmussen and Houze, 2011; Rehbein et al., 2018) and those of MCCs in the Maritime Continent by Trismidianto and Satyawardhana (2018). Analysis of the environmental conditions favourable for severe convective events indirectly INDICates the climatology and trends of severe convective events (Allen et al., 2018; Taszarek et al., 2018, 2019), though favourable conditions depend on the location, such as the difference for tornadoes associated with ETCs between the USA and Japan (Tochimoto and Niino, 2018)."
AR6_WG1_11_65,11,83,"Observed trends in severe convective storms are highly regionally dependent. In the USA, it is INDICated that there is no significant increase in convective storms, and hail and severe thunderstorms (Kunkel et al., 2013; Kossin et al., 2017). There is an upward trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in the USA (high confidence) (Kunkel et al., 2013; Easterling et al., 2017), and MCSs have increased in occurrence and precipitation amounts since 1979 (limited evidence) (Feng et al., 2016). Significant interannual variability of hailstone occurrences is found in the Southern Great Plains of the USA (Jeong et al., 2020). The mean annual number of tornadoes has remained relatively constant, but their variability of occurrence has increased since the 1970s, particularly over the 2000s, with a decrease in the number of days per year, but an increase in the number of tornadoes on these days (Brooks et al., 2014; Elsner et al., 2015, 2019; Kossin et al., 2017; Allen, 2018). There has been a shift in the distribution of tornadoes, with increases in the mid-south of the USA and decreases over the High Plains (Gensini and Brooks, 2018). Trends in MCSs are relatively more visible for"
AR6_WG1_11_66,11,83,"Studies on trends in severe convective storms and their ingredients outside of the USA are limited. Westra et al. (2014) found that there is an increase in the intensity of short-duration convective events (minutes to hours) over many regions of the world, except eastern China. In Europe, a climatology of tornadoes shows an increase in detected tornadoes between 1800 and 2014, but this trend might be affected by the density of observations (Antonescu et al., 2016a, b). An increase in the trend in extreme daily rainfall is found in south- eastern France, where MCSs play a key role in this type of event (Blanchet et al., 2018; Ribes et al., 2019). Trend analysis of the mean annual number of days with thunderstorms since 1979 in Europe INDICates an increase over the Alps and central, south-eastern, and eastern Europe, with a decrease over the south-west (Taszarek et al., 2019). In the Sahelian region, Taylor et al. (2017) analysed MCSs using satellite observations since 1982 and showed an increase in the frequency of extreme storms. In Bangladesh, the annual number of propagating MCSs decreased significantly during 1998–2015 based on TRMM precipitation data (Habib et al., 2019). Prein and Holland (2018) estimated the hail hazard from large-scale environmental conditions using a statistical approach and showed increasing trends in the USA, Europe, and Australia. However, trends in hail on regional scales are difficult to validate because of an insufficient length of observations and inhomogeneous records (Allen, 2018). The high spatial variability of hail suggests it is reasonable that there would be local signals of both positive and negative trends, and the trends that are occurring in hail globally are uncertain. In China, the total number of days that have either a thunderstorm or hail have decreased by about 50% from 1961 to 2010, and the reduction in these severe weather occurrences correlates strongly with the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon (Q. Zhang et al., 2017). More regional aspects of severe convective storms are detailed in Chapter 12."
AR6_WG1_11_67,11,86,"Changes in extreme winds are associated with changes in the characteristics (locations, frequencies, and intensities) of extreme storms, including TCs, ETCs, and severe convective storms. For TCs, as assessed in Section 11.7.1.5, it is projected that the average peak TC wind speeds will increase globally with warming, while the global frequency of TCs over all categories will decrease or remain unchanged; the average location where TCs reach their peak wind intensity will migrate poleward in the western North Pacific Ocean as the tropics expand with warming. Frequency, intensities, and geographical distributions of extreme wind events associated with TCs will change according to these TC changes. For ETCs, by the end of the century, CMIP5 models show that the number of ETCs associated with extreme winds will significantly decrease in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in winter, with the projected decrease being larger over the Atlantic (Kar-Man Chang, 2018), while it will significantly increase irrespective of the season in the Southern Hemisphere (Section 11.7.2.4; Chang, 2017). Over the ocean in the subtropics, a large ensemble of 60-km global model simulations INDICated that extreme winds associated with storm surges will intensify over 15–35°N in the Northern Hemisphere (Mori et al., 2019). However, extreme surface wind speeds will mostly decrease due to decreases in the number and intensity of TCs over most tropical areas of the Southern Hemisphere (Mori et al., 2019). The projected changes in the frequency of extreme winds are associated with the future changes in TCs and ETCs. Extreme cyclonic windstorms that share some characteristics with both TCs and ETCs occur regularly over the Mediterranean Sea and are often referred to as ‘medicanes’ (Ragone et al., 2018; Miglietta and Rotunno, 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). Medicanes pose substantial threats to regional islands and coastal zones. A growing body of literature consistently found that the frequency of medicanes decreases under warming, while the strongest medicanes become stronger (Gaertner et al., 2007; Romero and Emanuel, 2013, 2017; Cavicchia et al., 2014; Tous et al., 2016; Romera et al., 2017; González-Alemán et al., 2019). This is also consistent with expected global changes in TCs under warming (Section 11.7.1). Based on the consistency of these studies, it is likely that medicanes will decrease in frequency, while the strongest medicanes become stronger under warming scenario projections (medium confidence)."

AR6_WG1_11_69,11,93,"For projections, changes are assessed at three global warming levels (GWLs; Cross-Chapter Box 11.1): 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C. The assessments use literature based both on GWL projections and scenario-based projections. In the case of literature on scenario-based projections, a mapping between scenarios/time frames and GWLs was performed, as documented in Cross-Chapter Box 11.1. Projections of changes in temperature and precipitation extremes are assessed relative to two different baselines: the recent past (1995–2014) and pre-industrial (1850–1900). With smaller changes relative to the variability, in particular because droughts happen on longer timescales compared to extremes of daily temperature and precipitation, it is more difficult to distinguish changes in drought relative to the recent past. As such, changes in droughts are assessed relative to the pre-industrial baseline, unless INDICated otherwise."

Thresholds can be used to measure various aspects of the climatic impact-driver (magnitude or intensity, duration, frequency, timing, and spatial extent of threshold exceedance).

Next, Section 12.3 identifies climatic impact-drivers and their relevant INDICES that are frequently used in the context of climate impacts in the WGII focus sectors (AR6 WGII Chapters 2–8). The assessment of changes in regional-scale climatic impact-drivers is then developed within Section 12.4 by continent, following the structure of the WGII assessment report regional chapters (AR6 WGII Chapters 9–15), and adding the polar regions, open/deep ocean and other specific zones corresponding to the WGII Cross-Chapter Papers. Section 12.5 then presents a global perspective (both bottom-up and top-down) on the change of regional climatic impact-drivers, including an assessment of the ‘emergence’ of climatic impact-drivers.

Scientific literature on vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation (as typically asssessed in IPCC WGII) is examined to identify relevant climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) that contribute to sectoral risks and opportunities. Projected changes in corresponding CID INDICES are then derived from existing literature on changes in the physical climate system, results of other AR6 WGI chapters, and direct calculations based on climate projections from several model ensembles."

Thus, here we do not consider INDICATORs including exposure or vulnerability as assessed by WGII, although the selection of climatic impact-drivers is informed by literature feeding into WGII."
AR6_WG1_12_8,12,9,"CIDs can be captured in seven main types: heat and cold; wet and dry; wind; snow and ice; coastal; oceanic and other. Table 12.1 provides an overview of the seven CID types and the CID categories associated with each type. The type ‘Other’ comprises additional CIDs that are not encompassed within the other six CID types, including air pollution weather (e.g., meteorological conditions that favour high concentrations of surface ozone, particulate matter or other air pollutants), near-surface atmospheric CO concentrations, and mean radiation forcing at the surface (which are, for example, relevant for plant growth). Icebergs, fog and lightning are also noted in this chapter but are not broadly assessed across all subsections. In addition, there Chapter 12: Quick guide can be changes in impacts associated with earthquakes that interact with climate variables and climate change, such as liquefaction (e.g., Yasuhara et al., 2012) during earthquakes, or earthquakes caused by snow and water changes (Amos et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2017), which are secondary effects on geophysical hazards that are not further assessed in this chapter. The characteristics and physical description of the climate phenomena or essential climate variables associated with each of these CID categories are assessed and described in previous Chapters 2–11 or Chapter 12 directly as INDICated in Table 12.1. The CID categories are further mapped on to different sectors in Section 12.3 (Table 12.2)."
AR6_WG1_12_9,12,11,"For each CID category there can be a range of INDICES that capture the sector- or application-relevant characteristics of a climatic impact-driver as described in Sections 12.3 and 12.4. INDICES for climatic impact-drivers that are based on absolute or percentile thresholds (e.g., daily maximum temperature above 35°C) can be affected by biases in climate model simulations, such as local or regional deviations of a simulated climate variable from observed values (Sillmann et al., 2014; Dosio, 2016). Where sensible (i.e., where reliable observational data are available and a climate model that fits for the desired purpose), the output of climate model simulations can be bias-adjusted, potentially involving advanced methods to account for multiple variables and extreme value statistics as assessed in detail in Cross-Chapter Box 10.2. Yet, there is no general agreement about which bias adjustment methods to apply, as artefacts can arise both from the climate model and from the bias adjustment method, and the number of available methods has considerably grown in recent years (for a detailed discussion of available methods and their performance see Sections 10.3.1.3.2 and 10.3.3.7.2, and Cross- Chapter Box 10.2). The WGI Interactive Atlas illustrates original and bias-adjusted CIDs (see Atlas.1.4.5)."
AR6_WG1_12_10,12,11,"Climate change becomes relevant for regional impact management and for risk assessment when changes in mean conditions or episodic events affect natural and societal assets (system components with socio-economic, cultural or intrinsic value) positively or negatively (Table 12.2). Decision makers, policymakers, risk managers and engineers therefore benefit from climate information that tracks key trends and exceedance of thresholds that represent crucial challenges for natural and human systems. While useful INDICES can vary widely for a given sector and precise tolerance threshold values are often unknown, common metrics, categories and progressions of threshold levels allow experts to recognize coherent messages concerning altered regional impacts and risk profiles under climate change."

Impacts, risks and opportunities are rarely attributable to a single CID INDEX or threshold, but climate shifts that push conditions outside of expected conditions and beyond tolerance levels are INDICative of impact, risk or benefit given vulnerability and exposure. Focus is on direct sectoral connections of a CID (Hallegatte and Przyluski, 2010) rather than cascading or secondary effects (e.g., water-borne diseases following a flood, mental health challenges following a severe storm, or the effects of drought on poverty), as these are strongly affected by exposure, vulnerability and response, as discussed in the WGII Report."

AR6_WG1_12_13,12,14,"Information about increasing mean annual and seasonal air temperature is relevant in the determination of suitable species range for terrestrial, freshwater and intertidal species (Thomas et al., 2004; Elith et al., 2010; Hincapie and Caicedo, 2013; Cooper, 2014; Krist et al., 2014; Lindner et al., 2014; Saintilan et al., 2014; Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Myers-Smith et al., 2015; Urban, 2015; Thorne et al., 2017). Ocean ecosystems are affected by the ocean temperature CID (described in Section 12.3.6.1). Species redistribution and extinction studies also need information about climate velocity, a comparison of the pace of warming to geographical temperature gradients that INDICates the rate at which a species would have to move to maintain its climatological temperature (Thomas et al., 2004; Loarie et al., 2009; Dobrowski et al., 2013; Burrows et al., 2014; Dobrowski and Parks, 2016; Sittaro et al., 2017) with some studies incorporating additional variables beyond temperature (Hamann et al., 2015). Many freshwater ecosystems are strongly constrained by stream and lake temperatures (Scheurer et al., 2009; Comte and Grenouillet, 2013; Contador et al., 2014; Knouft and Ficklin, 2017). Warmer and more stratified lake temperatures are more conducive to cyanobacteria blooms with implications for ecosystem health and water resource quality (Whitehead et al., 2009; Moss et al., 2011; Jones and Brett, 2014; Chapra et al., 2017; Shatwell et al., 2019). Consideration of nighttime and daytime temperature trends also elucidates different biophysical effects on vegetation (Peng et al., 2013). Changes in the seasonal timing caused by warming trends are critical to species ranges and ecosystem function (Pearce-Higgins et al., 2015; Hughes et al., 2017b), and INDICES that characterize the onset of spring shed light on plant emergence and development (Ault et al., 2015). Mean air temperature dictates many aspects of crop cultivation, livestock production, agroforestry and output from freshwater aquaculture and fisheries, as well as the potential for food contamination. Mean warming alters suitable cultivation zones for crop species (Bragança et al., 2016; Gendron St-Marseille et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c) and tree species (Hanewinkel et al., 2013; Fei et al., 2017). Crop and ecosystem service productivity often responds directly to mean temperatures, although this is dependent on farming systems (Bassu et al., 2014; Challinor et al., 2014; Lobell and Tebaldi, 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Asseng et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Fleisher et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017; Smith and Fazil, 2019). Many studies relate plant development (phenology), insect generation cycles and pest outbreaks to growing degree days, an aggregation of daily thermal units above a threshold (e.g., T >5°C) that accelerates with warmer conditions (Hof and Svahlin, 2016; Ruosteenoja et al., 2016; Tripathi et al., 2016). Many plants respond to changes in nighttime temperatures that affect respiration and transpiration rates (Narayanan et al., 2015; X. Chen et al., 2019), and warming of the soil column is also relevant to determine plant sprouting (Grotjahn, 2021). A number of INDICES have been developed to represent the length of the viable local growing season, including a count of days where T >5°C (Mueller et al., 2015) or the period between a year’s first and last set of five consecutive days with a weighted T ≥10°C (G. Li et al., 2018). Warmer conditions and altered seasonality modify the range and metabolism of some pollinators, pests, diseases and weeds (Wolfe et al., 2008; Bebber, 2015; Aljaryian and Kumar, 2016; IPBES, 2016; Ramesh et al., 2017; Deutsch et al., 2018; Nyangiwe et al., 2018) and may reduce the effectiveness of winter storage for farmers and caching species (Sutton et al., 2016)."
AR6_WG1_12_14,12,14,"Warming raises accumulated seasonal heat INDICES used in livestock production, especially when humidity is high (Key et al., 2014; Lallo et al., 2018), determines aquaculture suitability and is important for wild fish species migration (Tripathi et al., 2016; Brander et al., 2017). Agricultural planners may also calculate how overall warming trends alter the accumulation of vernalization units or chilling hours for agricultural or horticultural crops (often accumulated temperature deficit below a given daily or hourly threshold; Dennis and Peacock, 2009; Luedeling, 2012; Tripathi et al., 2016; Grotjahn, 2021). Warming in the post-harvest is also important for the determination of spoilage and waste (Stathers et al., 2013) as well as food-borne diseases (Kovats et al., 2004; Mbow et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_12_15,12,14,"Impacts and risk assessments utilize a large variety of INDICES and approaches tailored to evaluate heat impacts on human health (Sanderson et al., 2017; C. Gao et al., 2018; McGregor and Vanos, 2018; Staiger et al., 2019; J. Zhu et al., 2019; Schwingshackl et al., 2021). A mixture of simple and complex heat stress INDICES often combine"
AR6_WG1_12_16,12,15,"Short-term exposure of crops to temperatures beyond a critical temperature threshold can lead to lower yields and above a limiting temperature threshold, crops may fail altogether (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; Lobell et al., 2012, 2013; Gourdji et al., 2013; Deryng et al., 2014; Schauberger et al., 2017; Tesfaye et al., 2017; Vogel et al., 2019). The exact level of these thresholds depends on species, cultivar and farm management (Hatfield and Prueger, 2015; Hatfield et al., 2015; Bisbis et al., 2018; Grotjahn, 2021). The timing of heatwaves is particularly important, as extreme heat is more damaging during critical phenological stages (Teixeira et al., 2013; Eyshi Rezaei et al., 2015; Fontana et al., 2015; B. Wang et al., 2017; Mäkinen et al., 2018). Extreme canopy temperatures, rather than 2 m air temperatures, may be a more robust biophysical INDICATOR of heat impacts on crop production (Siebert et al., 2017). Heat stress INDICES based upon temperature and humidity determine livestock productivity as well as conception and mortality rates (Key et al., 2014; Dash et al., 2016; Pragna et al., 2016; Rojas-Downing et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_12_17,12,17,"A large variety of climate INDICES and models are utilized to understand how river flooding affects both natural or built environments with highly variable hazard thresholds, given unique local topography and engineered defences such as dams and polders (Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Ekström et al., 2018). Key transportation routes, built infrastructure and agricultural lands are threatened when floods exceed design standards commonly based around flood magnitudes of a given historic return period (e.g., 1-in-100-year flood event), an annual exceedance probability or precipitation intensity-duration- frequency relationships with key INDICES (e.g., 10-day cumulative precipitation) related to catchment size and properties (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Kundzewicz et al., 2014; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Dikanski et al., 2016; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; Forzieri et al., 2017; Fluixá-Sanmartín et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019). Floods and high-flow events can scour river beds and elevate silt loads, reducing water quality and accelerating deposition in estuaries and reservoirs (Khan et al., 2018; Parasiewicz et al., 2019). Floods can knock down, drown or wash away crops and livestock, and partially submerged plants can have yield reduction depending on water turbidity and their development stage (Ruane et al., 2013; Shrestha et al., 2019). Basin snowpack properties may also be important during heavy rain events, as rain-on-snow events can lead to rapid acceleration of flood stages that threaten wildlife and society (Hansen et al., 2014)."
AR6_WG1_12_18,12,17,"Landslides, mudslides, rockfalls and other mass movements can lead to fatalities, destroy infrastructure and housing stock, and block critical transportation routes. Climate models cannot resolve these complex slope failure processes (nor triggering mechanisms such as earthquakes), so most studies rely on proxies or conditions conducive to slope failure (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; Ho et al., 2017).

AR6_WG1_12_19,12,17,"Aridity INDICES may track long-term changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration demand, surface water, groundwater or soil moisture (Sherwood and Fu, 2014; Herrera-Pantoja and Hiscock, 2015; B.I. Cook et al., 2020). Changes in soil moisture and surface water can shift the rate of carbon uptake by ecosystems (Humphrey et al., 2018) and alter suitable climate zones for wild species and agricultural cultivation (Feng and Fu, 2013; Garcia et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2016a; Schlaepfer et al., 2017; Fatemi et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019c) as well as the prevalence of related pests and pathogen-carrying vectors (Paritsis and Veblen, 2011; Smith et al., 2020). Water table depth, in relation to rooting depth, is also important for farms and forests under dry conditions (Feng et al., 2006). A reduction in water availability (via aridity or hydrological drought) challenges water supplies needed for for municipal, industrial, agriculture and hydropower use (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Schewe et al., 2014; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; van Vliet et al., 2016)."
AR6_WG1_12_20,12,17,"Water managers often utilize a variety of hydrological drought INDICES and hydrological models to characterize water resources, low flow conditions and the potential for irrigation (Wanders and Wada, 2015; Mukherjee et al., 2018). Low flow volume and intermittency thresholds can INDICate reductions in dissolved oxygen, more concentrated pollutants, and higher stream temperatures relevant for ecosystems, water resource quality and thermal power plant cooling (Feeley et al., 2008; Döll and Schmied, 2012; Schaeffer et al., 2012; Prudhomme et al., 2014; van Vliet et al., 2016). Low water levels may also restrict waterway navigation for commerce and recreation (Forzieri et al., 2018). 12.3.2.7 Agricultural and Ecological Drought"
AR6_WG1_12_21,12,17,"Agricultural and ecological drought INDICES relate to the ability of plants to meet growth and transpiration needs (Table 11.3; Zargar et al., 2011; Lobell et al., 2015; Pedro-Monzonís et al., 2015; Bachmair et al., 2016; Wehner et al., 2017; Naumann et al., 2018) and the timing and duration of droughts can lead to substantially different impacts (Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019). Drought stress for agriculture and ecosystems is difficult to directly observe, and therefore scientists use a variety of drought INDICES (Table 11.3), proxy information about changes in precipitation supply and reference evapotranspiration demand, the ratio of actual/potential evapotranspiration or a deficit in available soil water content, particularly at rooting level (Park Williams et al., 2013; Trnka et al., 2014; C.D. Allen et al., 2015; Svoboda and Fuchs, 2017; Mäkinen et al., 2018; Otkin et al., 2018). Severe water stress can lead to crop failure, in particular when droughts persist for an extended period or occur during key plant developmental stages (Hatfield et al., 2014; Jolly et al., 2015; Leng and Hall, 2019). Projections"
AR6_WG1_12_22,12,18,"Complex fire weather INDICES shed light on conditions that increase the likelihood of wildfire and shifts in the fire season (Flannigan et al., 2013; Bedia et al., 2015; Jolly et al., 2015; Harvey, 2016; Littell et al., 2016; Westerling, 2016; Abatzoglou et al., 2019), which pose particularly acute challenges for indigenous communities (Christianson and McGee, 2019). Projection of future lightning frequency provides information on an important natural triggering mechanism, particularly when coupled with long-term warming and drying trends (Romps et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2015; Veraverbeke et al., 2017). Fuel aridity metrics also help determine vegetative fuel desiccation and therefore the ignitability, flammability and spread of fires when they occur (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). The presence of snow cover can influence the length of the fire season and the penetration of fire danger into new portions of the Arctic tundra (Young et al., 2017; Abatzoglou et al., 2019). Data on the changing characteristics of local wind circulations like the Santa Ana in California shed light on future intensity and spread patterns for fires (Jin et al., 2015). Fires also produce smoke plumes that reduce air and water quality (via deposition), adversely affecting health, visibility and water resources both near and far downwind (Dennekamp and Abramson, 2011; McKenzie et al., 2014; Dreessen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Martin, 2016)."
AR6_WG1_12_23,12,18,"Tropical cyclones and severe coastal storms can deliver wind, water and coastal hazards with the potential for widespread mortality and damages to cities, housing, transportation and energy infrastructure, ecosystems and agricultural lands (Burkett, 2011; NASEM, 2012; Bell et al., 2013; Wehof et al., 2014; Ward et al., 2016; Cheal et al., 2017; Godoi et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019; Pinnegar et al., 2019). Storm planning is often tied to the Saffir –Simpson scale related to peak sustained wind speed (Izaguirre et al., 2021), with several INDICES focusing on storms’ overall power and energy, size and translation speed to anticipate destructive potential (Knutson et al., 2015; Wang and Toumi, 2016; Parker et al., 2018; Hassanzadeh et al., 2020)."
AR6_WG1_12_24,12,19,"A large number of INDICES have been used in water resource and ecosystem studies to track changes in snow under current and future climate conditions, including measurements of the snow water equivalent at key seasonal dates, the fraction of precipitation falling as snow, the first and last days of snow cover, and cold season temperatures (Mills et al., 2013; Pierce and Cayan, 2013; Berghuijs et al., 2014; Klos et al., 2014; Musselman et al., 2017; Rhoades et al., 2018). Impact studies also examine shifts in seasonal streamflow for snow-fed river basins (Mote et al., 2005; Pederson et al., 2011; Beniston and Stoffel, 2014; Coppola et al., 2014b, 2018; Fyfe et al., 2017; Islam et al., 2017; Knouft and Ficklin, 2017) as well as the geographic extent of snow cover and the depth of frosts when snow cover’s natural insulation is absent (Scheurer et al., 2009; Millar and Stephenson, 2015). Studies examining the impact of snow changes on winter recreation and transportation have used thresholds of about 30 cm snow depth or snow water equivalent >10 cm to determine the length of the season for alpine and cross- country skiing and snowmobiling (Damm et al., 2017; Wobus et al., 2017b; Spandre et al., 2019; Steiger et al., 2019; Abegg et al., 2021). Changes in snow quality also affect recreational activities (Rutty et al., 2017), and artificial snowmaking can augment recreational snowpack depending on the number of suitable snowmaking hours (e.g., where wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) <–2.2°C; Wobus et al., 2017b). Local detail may also be provided by tracking the seasonal rain–snow transition line across space and elevation (Berghuijs et al., 2014) (Pierce and Cayan, 2013; Berghuijs et al., 2014; Klos et al., 2014; Musselman et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_12_25,12,20,"12.3.5.1 Relative Sea Level Sea level rise hazards for coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, farmland, cities and settlements in a particular region are often driven by regional changes in relative sea level (RSL) that account for land uplift or subsidence and thus represent local asset vulnerability better than global mean sea level (Box 9.1; Hallegatte et al., 2013; Hinkel et al., 2013; McInnes et al., 2016; Weatherdon et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b; Rasoulkhani et al., 2020). Vertical land motion (i.e., land subsidence) caused by local fluid (gas or groundwater) extraction can also have a large influence on relative sea levels (Minderhoud et al., 2020). Several INDICES have been suggested to signify coastal inundation, including a threshold when the local land elevation falls below the local mean higher high water (MHHW) that is close to the ‘high tide’ level (Kulp and Strauss, 2019) or a threshold when flooding occurs about once every two weeks (Sweet and Park, 2014; Dahl et al., 2017b). RSL rise (or RSLR) can drive increased inland penetration of above-ground and subterranean salt water fronts (i.e., salinity intrusion) affecting coastal ecosystems, agriculture and water resources (Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013; Rotzoll and Fletcher, 2013; Chen et al., 2016; Colombani et al., 2016; Holding et al., 2016; Sawyer et al., 2016; Mohammed and Scholz, 2018). The rate of RSLR can determine the survival and net pressure on niche coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, tidal flats, sea grasses and coral reefs (Hubbard et al., 2008; Craft et al., 2009; Bell et al., 2013; Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013; Alongi, 2015; Ellison, 2015; Lovelock et al., 2015; Ward et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018). 12.3.5.2 Coastal Flood"
AR6_WG1_12_26,12,20,"12.3.5.3 Coastal Erosion Effective management of coastal ecosystems, cities, settlements, beaches and infrastructure requires information about coastal erosion driven by storm surge, waves and sea level rise (Dawson et al., 2009; Hinkel et al., 2013; Harley et al., 2017; Mentaschi et al., 2017). Coastal erosion is generally accompanied by shoreline retreat, which can occur as a gradual process (e.g., due to sea level rise) or as an episodic event due to storm surge and/or extreme waves, especially when combined with high tide (Ranasinghe, 2016). The most commonly used shoreline retreat INDEX is the magnitude of shoreline retreat by a pre-determined planning horizon such as 50 or 100 years into the future. Commonly used metrics for episodic coastal erosion include the beach erosion volume due to the 100-year recurrence storm wave height, the full exceedance probability distribution of coastal erosion volume (Li et al., 2014a; Pender et al., 2015; Ranasinghe and Callaghan, 2017) and the cumulative storm energy and storm power INDEX (Godoi et al., 2018). The destruction or overtopping of barrier islands may lead to irreversible changes in the physical system as well as in coastal ecosystems (Carrasco et al., 2016; Zinnert et al., 2019). Shoreline position change rates along inlet-interrupted coasts may also be affected by changes in river flows and fluvial sediment supply (Hinkel et al., 2013; Bamunawala et al., 2018; Ranasinghe et al., 2019). Permafrost thaw and Arctic sea ice decline also reduce natural coastal protection from wave erosion for communities and industry (Forbes, 2011; Melvin et al., 2017)."
AR6_WG1_12_27,12,21,"Marine heatwaves (MHW) push water temperatures above key thresholds and have been associated with coral bleaching episodes, species shifts and harmful algal blooms that can disrupt ecosystems, tourism and human health (Box 9.2; Wernberg et al., 2016; Arias- Ortiz et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2018; Frölicher, 2019; Smale et al., 2019; Sully et al., 2019). The duration and return period of marine heatwaves provide insight into aggregate stresses on marine species, fisheries and ecosystems, with various INDICES gauging cumulative intensity or the number of days, weeks or months exceeding critical thresholds (Frieler et al., 2013; Frölicher et al., 2018; Hughes et al., 2018b; Cheung and Frölicher, 2020). Hobday et al. (2016) defined marine heatwaves as the exceedance of the 90th percentile of the sea surface temperature (SST) distribution on a given Julian day during five or more consecutive days, while Box 9.2, Figure 1 shows MHW as an exceedance of 99th-percentile 11-day de-seasonalized SSTs. The return period of marine heatwaves is also critical in determining a coral system’s ability to recover before the next event (Hughes et al., 2018a)."
AR6_WG1_12_28,12,21,"Although future air pollution will be strongly driven by air quality policies, anthropogenically-driven changes to temperature, humidity, precipitation and synoptic patterns have the potential to affect the emissions, production, concentration and transport of particulate matter (e.g., from dust, fires, pollen) and gaseous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, tropospheric ozone and nitrogen dioxide (Section 6.5) with resulting impacts on human health, agriculture and ecosystems (Ren et al., 2011; Fiore et al., 2015; Kinney et al., 2015a; Tian et al., 2016; Orru et al., 2017; Emberson et al., 2018; Hayes et al., 2020). Information about conditions leading to poor air quality is also important for visibility in natural parks and tourist locations (Yue et al., 2013; Val Martin et al., 2015), as well as the efficiency of solar photovoltaic panels (Sweerts et al., 2019). Relevant information about conditions favouring air pollution includes tracking warmer conditions that accelerate ozone formation (Peel et al., 2013; Schnell et al., 2016) and the frequency and duration of stagnant air events (Horton et al., 2014; Fann et al., 2015; Lelieveld et al., 2015; Vautard et al., 2018), although no regional INDEX has proven sufficient to capture regional changes or acute events (Kerr and Waugh, 2018; Schnell et al., 2018). By contrast, precipitation and moister air tend to reduce pollution (Section 6.5)."
AR6_WG1_12_29,12,22,"Threats to many sectoral assets and associated systems may also be compounded when multiple hazards occur simultaneously in the same place, affect multiple regions at the same time, or occur in a sequence that may amplify overall impact (Section 11.8; IPCC, 2012; Clarke et al., 2018; Zscheischler et al., 2018; Raymond et al., 2020). There is emerging literature on many connected extremes and their associated hazards (e.g., climatic conditions that could drive multi-breadbasket failures; Trnka et al., 2019; Kornhuber et al., 2020), but a full accounting is not practical here especially considering the many possible CID combinations and the need to assess how exposed systems would be vulnerable to compound CIDs (assessed in WGII). Table 12.2 is once again instructive here in considering hazard-related storylines, as the multiple CIDs affecting a given sectoral asset (assessing across a row of Table 12.2) point to potentially dangerous hazard combinations. Similarly, change in a single CID has the potential to affect multiple sectoral assets (assessing down a column of Table 12.2) in a manner with broader systemic implications (AR6 WGII). Recent literature defines CID INDICES to represent trends and thresholds that influence sectoral assets, albeit with considerable variation owing to the unique characteristics of regional and sectoral assets. INDICES include direct information about the CID’s profile (magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, spatial extent) or utilize atmospheric conditions as a proxy for CIDs that are more difficult to directly observe or simulate. Each sector is affected by multiple CIDs, and each CID affects multiple sectors. Assets within the same sector may require different or tailored INDICES even for the same CID. These INDICES may be defined to capture graduated thresholds associated with tipping points or inflection points in a particular sectoral vulnerability, with commonalities in the types of processes these thresholds represent even as their precise magnitude may vary by specific sectoral system and asset."
AR6_WG1_12_30,12,22,"This section describes the historical and projected changes in commonly used INDICES and thresholds associated with the main climatic impact-drivers (Sections 12.2 and 12.3) at the scale of AR6 regions described in Figure 1.18a. The section is organised by continents (Sections 12.4.1–12.4.6) with a specific assessment for Small Islands (Section 12.4.7), open and deep ocean (Section 12.4.8), and polar regions (Section 12.4.9) as defined in Chapter 1 (Figure 1.18c). In addition, CID INDICES and thresholds relevant to ‘specific zones’, as defined in AR6 WGII Cross-Chapter Papers, are assessed in Section 12.4.10 except for the Mediterranean, which is addressed both under Africa and Europe (Sections 12.4.1 and 12.4.5) and is a focus in Section 10.6.4. Regional assessment method and tables: In each section herein (Sections 12.4.1–12.4.10), we assess changes in sector-relevant CIDs following the main CID categories defined in Section 12.2 through commonly used INDICES and thresholds relevant for sectors described in 12.3. Sections 12.4.1–12.4.9 each include a summary qualitative CID assessment table (Tables 12.3–12.11) showing the confidence levels associated with the direction of projected CID changes (i.e., increasing or decreasing) for the mid-century period (2041–2060) relative to the recent past, for scenarios RCP4.5, SSP2‑4.5, SRES A1B, or above (RCP6.0, RCP8.5, SSP3‑7.0, SSP5‑8.5, SRES A2), which approximately encompasses GWLs of 2.0°C to 2.4°C (as best estimate; see Chapter 4, Table 4.5). For scenarios RCP2.6, SSP1‑2.6 or SSP1‑1.9, the signal may have lower confidence levels in some cases due to smaller overall changes, embedded in a similar internal variability, and to the availability of relatively few studies that account for these scenarios. Nevertheless, CID changes under these lower emissions scenarios are included in the text whenever information is available. For each cell in Tables 12.3–12.11, literature is assessed, aided by global Figure 12.4 or regional Figures 12.5–12.10. Confidence in projections is established considering evidence emerging from observations, attribution and projections, as explained in Cross-Chapter Box 10.3 while considering the amount of evidence and agreement across models and studies and model generations."
AR6_WG1_12_31,12,22,"The confidence levels associated with the directions of projected CID changes are synthesized assessments based on literature that may utilize different INDICES and baseline periods or projections by GWLs. For extreme heat, cold spell, heavy precipitation and drought CIDs that are assessed in Chapter 11, here we draw projections from the 2°C GWL tables in Section 11.9. In some cases, more details are needed in order to emphasize one aspect of projected CID change. For instance, the change in a CID may be different for intensity, duration, frequency; or there can be strong sub-regional or seasonal signals; or different CID INDICES may have conflicting signals. A footnote is added in such cases, but a confidence level for a direction of projected change is given based on the Section 12.3 assessment of aspects of regional CID change that are most relevant for impacts and for risks. As an example, tropical cyclones are increasing in intensity but decreasing in frequency in some regions. Here, in assessing the confidence of the direction of projected change in the Tropical cyclone CID (i.e., the colour of the table cell), we assign more weight to the ‘intensity’ rather than the ‘frequency’, corresponding to the higher relevance of the intensity of major tropical cyclones for risk assessment. Low confidence of changes, arising from lack of evidence, strong spatial or seasonal heterogeneity, or lack of agreement, are represented by colour-less cells, and, for the sake of simplicity, only two categories of confidence are given: medium confidence and high confidence (and higher). In addition, CID assessment tables also INDICate observed"

The figure INDICES and impact-relevant thresholds are described in Annex VI: Climatic Impact-drivers and Extreme INDICES. Figure 12.4 shows changes in six CID INDICES. These global maps are derived from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations for different time periods and scenarios (except for extreme total water level where CMIP Phase 5 (CMIP5) is used). The uncertainty due to climate models, time, scenarios and regional downscaling is illustrated in Supplementary Material SM.12.1 to SM.12.6, which show the distribution of the spatial average of the INDEX among models over each land region for CMIP5, CMIP6 and Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) ensembles for the recent past, mid- and end-21st century, and for GWLs of +1.5°C, +2°C and +4°C.

Areas below calcium carbonate saturation thresholds expanded from the 1990s to 2010 and Meredith et al. (2019) INDICated that both the Southern and Arctic Oceans will experience year-round under-saturation conditions by 2100 under RCP8.5. The vertical level of the aragonite saturation horizon off the Pacific coast of North America has risen towards the surface by 30–50 m since pre-industrial times (Mathis et al., 2015b; Feely et al., 2016). In a study of US coastlines, Ekstrom et al. (2015) mapped out the projected year when aragonite saturation state drops below 1.5 (a sublethal threshold for bivalve mollusc larvae), finding hazardous conditions before 2030 from northern Oregon to Alaska and before 2100 for the Pacific coast and Atlantic coastline north of New Jersey. Mathis et al.

AR6_WG1_12_36,12,25,"Radiation at surface: Radiation has undergone decadal variations in past observations, which are mostly responding to the so-called dimming and brightening phenomenon driven by the increase and decrease of aerosols. Over the last two decades or so, brightening continues in Europe and North America and dimming stabilizes over South and East Asia and increases in some other areas (Section 7.2.2.3). Future regional shortwave radiation projections depend mostly on cloud trends, aerosol and water vapour trends, and stratospheric ozone when considering UV radiation. Over Africa in 2050 and beyond, there is medium confidence that radiation will increase in North and South Africa and decrease over the Sahara, North Eastern Africa and Western Africa (Wild et al., 2015, 2017; Soares et al., 2019; C. Tang et al., 2019; Sawadogo et al., 2020, 2021). Over Asia, the CMIP5 multi-model mean response shows that solar radiation will decrease in South Asia and increase in East Asia (medium confidence) by the mid-century RCP8.5 (Wild et al., 2015, 2017; Ruosteenoja et al., 2019b). Projected solar resources show an increasing trend throughout the 21st century in East Asia under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios in CMIP5 simulations (medium confidence) (Wild et al., 2015; F. Zhang et al., 2018; Shiogama et al., 2020). More sunshine is projected over Australia in winter and spring by the end of the century (medium confidence) with the increases in Southern Australia exceeding 10% (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Wild et al., 2015). In Central and South America, there is medium confidence of increasing solar radiation over the Amazon basin and the northern part of South America (medium confidence) (Wild et al., 2015, 2017; de Jong et al., 2019). There is low confidence for an increase in surface radiation in central Europe, owing in particular to disagreement in cloud cover across global and regional models (Jerez et al., 2015; Bartók et al., 2017; Craig et al., 2018), as well as water vapour. The treatment of aerosol appears to be key in explaining these differences (Boé, 2016; Undorf et al., 2018; Boé et al., 2020; Gutiérrez et al., 2020). Regional and global studies, however, INDICate that there is medium confidence in increasing radiation over southern Europe and decreasing radiation over Northern Europe. Increasing radiation trends are also found over southern and eastern USA, and decreasing trends over North-Western North America (Wild et al., 2015; Losada Carreño et al., 2020), despite large differences between responses from regional climate models (RCMs) and general circulation models (GCMs) over southern and eastern USA (low confidence), where, as for Central Europe, the role of aerosols appears important (Chen, 2021). Over polar regions there is medium confidence of a decrease in radiation due to increasing moisture in the atmosphere and clouds (Wild et al., 2015)."

Sun et al., 2019). In particular the equatorial regions where heat is combined with higher humidity levels, but also North Africa, the Sahel and Southern Africa (Figure 12.4d–f) are among the regions with the largest increases of heat stress (Zhao et al., 2015; Ahmadalipour and Moradkhani, 2018; Coffel et al., 2018). Mitigation scenarios make a large difference in frequency of exceedance of high heat stress INDICES thresholds (e.g., HI > 41°C) by the end of the century (Figure 12.4d–f; Schwingshackl et al., 2021). In West Africa and Central Africa, under SSP5‑8.5, the expected number of days per year with HI > 41°C will increase by around 200 days while in SSP1‑2.6 such exceedances are expected to increase by less than 50 days per year (Figure 12.4; Figure 12.SM.2)."

By the same period but under RCP8.5, the median shoreline retreat is projected to be between 35 m (SAH, NEAF, WSAF, ESAF) and 65 m (WAF, CAF). By 2100, more than 100 m of median retreat is projected in WAF, CAF and SEAF under RCP4.5, while under RCP8.5, more than 100 m of shoreline retreat is projected in all regions except NEAF and WSAF.

Human activities such as reservoir operation and water abstraction have had a profound effect on low river flow characteristics and drought impacts in many Asian regions (Kazemzadeh and Malekian, 2016; Yang et al., 2020b). There was no observed overall long-term change of both meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts over India during 1870–2018 (Mishra, 2020), but there were strong trends towards drying of soil moisture in north-central India (Ganeshi et al., 2020) and intensified droughts in north-west India, parts of Peninsular India, and Myanmar (Malik et al., 2016).

In New Zealand, since 1972–73, soils at 7 of 30 monitored sites became drier, while the 2012–13 drought was one of the most extreme in the previous 41 years (MfE and Stats NZ, 2017). Future evaporative demand is projected to lead to medium confidence increases in agricultural and ecological droughts for 2°C of global warming in SAU and EAU and low confidence for changes in CAU, NAU and NZ, although there is medium confidence of increases in CAU with 4°C of global warming (Section 11.9). There is medium confidence for more time in agricultural and ecological drought in SAU by mid-21st century (Coppola et al., 2021b) as well as by the end of the 21st century (Herold et al., 2018). The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration INDEX (SPEI) shows a springtime intensification in SAU with moderate and severe droughts in the south-west and moderate droughts in the south-east (Herold et al., 2018). There is consensus among the different model ensembles (CORDEX-CORE, CMIP5 and CMIP6) that the drought frequency (DF), one of several proxies for agricultural and ecological drought, will increase in all four Australian regions for both mid-century (NAU 0.2–2 DF increase, CAU 0.5–2 DF increase, SAU 1–3 DF increase and EAU 0.8–3 DF increase) and end-century (0.8–2.7 DF increase for NAU, 1.2–2 DF increase for CAU, 2.2–3.8 for SAU and 0.2–3 for EAU) for both RCP8.5 and SSP5‑8.5, with CMIP6 showing the lowest increase (Figure 12.4g–l and Figure 12.SM.4; Coppola et al., 2021b)."
AR6_WG1_12_62,12,43,"Fire weather: Dowdy and Pepler (2018) examined atmospheric conditions conducive to pyroconvection in the period 1979–2016, and found an increased risk in south-east Australia during spring and summer, due to changes in vertical atmospheric stability and humidity, in combination with adverse near-surface fire weather conditions. CSIRO and BOM (2018) and Dowdy (2018) found that the annual 90th percentile daily Forest Fire Danger INDEX (FFDI) has increased from 1950–2016 in parts of Australia, especially in Southern Australia (1–2.5 per decade) and in spring and summer. These studies INDICate an increase in the frequency and magnitude of FFDI extreme quantiles, as well as a shift of the fire season start towards spring, lengthening the fire season. The unprecedented large fires of austral spring and summer of 2019 in south-east Australia were a result of extreme hot and dry weather in significantly drier than average conditions that had persisted since 2017, in combination with consistently stronger than average winds, resulting in above average to highest on record FFDI values in much of the country (Abram et al., 2021). These fires have been attributed to climate change through the temperature component of fire weather INDICES (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021). In New Zealand, days with very high and extreme fire weather increased in 12 out of 28 monitored sites, and decreased in 8, in the period 1997–2019 (MfE and Stats NZ, 2020). Attribution studies INDICate that there is medium confidence of an anthropogenically driven past increase in fire weather conditions, essentially due to increase in frequency of extreme heat waves. (Hope et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021)."
AR6_WG1_12_63,12,43,"Fire weather INDICES are projected to increase in most of Australia (high confidence) and many parts of New Zealand (medium confidence), in particular with respect to extreme fire and induced pyroconvection (Dowdy et al., 2019b). Increasing mean temperature, cool season rainfall decline, and changes in tropical climate variability all contribute to a future increase in extreme fire risk in Australia (Abram et al., 2021). Projections INDICate that the annual cumulative FFDI will increase by 31–33% in Southern and Eastern Australia, and by 17–25% in Northern Australia and the Rangelands by 2090 (relative to 1995) under RCP8.5 (CSIRO and BOM, 2015). Using a CMIP5 ensemble of 17 models, Abatzoglou et al. (2019) found a statistically significant positive trend for fire weather intensity and fire season length for future mid-century conditions under RCP8.5, including a detectable anthropogenic influence on fire risk magnitude and fire season length by 2040 in Western Australia and along the Queensland coastline. Using the C-Haines and FFDI INDICES with A2 and RCP8.5 respectively, Di Virgilio et al. (2019) and Clarke et al. (2019) have shown that extreme fire weather frequency will increase in south-eastern Australia by the end of the 21st century. Most of these projections INDICate that the biggest increases in fire weather conditions will be in late spring, effectively resulting in longer (stronger) fire seasons in areas where spring is the shoulder (peak) season. In New Zealand, Watt et al. (2019) projected that the number of days with very high to extreme fire risk will increase by 71% by 2040, and by a further 12% by 2090, for the A1B scenario, with fire risk increase all along the east coast. The most marked relative changes by 2090 were projected for Wellington and Dunedin, where very high to extreme fire risk is projected to increase by, respectively, 89% to 32 days and 207% to 18 days, compared to the baseline period 1970–1999."

Elsewhere trends are diverse and vary across simulations with low agreement. Projections of changes in the 1-in-25-year return period winds (based on annual maxima) for 2074–2100 relative to 1979–2005 for RCP8.5 show an increase in tropical areas of Northern Australia (Kumar et al., 2015)."

However, episodic coastal flooding is caused by extreme total water levels (ETWL), which is the combination of SLR, tides, surge and wave setup (Section 12.3.5.2). The present-day 1-in-100-year ETWL is between 0.5–2.5 m around most of Australia, except the north- western coast where 1-in-100-year ETWL can be as large as 6–7 m (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; O’Grady et al., 2019; Kirezci et al., 2020)."

(2020b) show that, by mid-century, sandy shorelines will retreat (relative to 2010) by between 50 and 80 m all around Australasia, except in SAU and NZ where the projected retreat (relative to 2010) is between 35 and 50 m. By 2100, median shoreline retreats exceeding 100 m (relative to 2010) are projected along the sandy coasts of NAU (about 150 m), CAU (about 160 m), and EAU (about 110 m) under RCP4.5m, while projections for SAU and NZ are around 80–90 m. Under RCP8.5, shoreline retreat exceeding 100 m is projected all around the region by 2100 (relative to 2010) with retreats as high as 220 m in NAU and CAU (about 170 m in EAU and about 130 m in SAU and NZ; Figure 12.7b,d). The total length of sandy coasts in Australasia that is projected to retreat by more than a median of 100 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is about 12,500 and 16,000 km respectively, an increase of approximately 30%."

IPCC AR5 projections (IPCC, 2014b) pointed to increases in mean temperature between 2°C and 6°C by the end of the century (high confidence) and increases in the occurrence of warm days and nights under various future climate scenarios (medium confidence). The AR5 also pointed to patterns of changes in precipitation (medium confidence), changes in the duration of dry spells (medium confidence) and decreases in water supply (high confidence). The SR1.5 projections INDICated expected increases in river flooding and extreme runoff at 2°C warming in parts of South America, and decreases in runoff in Central America, central and Southern South America, and the Amazon basin. The SROCC reported an increased number of landslides, a decreased volume of lahars from ice and snow-clad volcanoes, and increased frequency of glacier lake outburst floods. The SROCC also INDICated that regional and local-scale projections point to decreasing trends in glacier runoff."

Atlas projections point to a virtually certain warming across all sub-regions, with the largest increases taking place in the Amazon basin (NSA and SAM; Atlas.7.2.4). A consistent increase in temperature-related INDICES linked to several climate-sensitive sectors (e.g., growing degree days, cooling degree days) is found across CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX-CORE projections, with smaller increases for cooling degree days in mid-latitude regions than in SCA and the Amazon (Coppola et al., 2021b). Daily mean temperature exceedances of a typical 21.5°C threshold for a successful incubation of disease pathogens inside many mosquito vectors (Lambrechts et al., 2011; Blanford et al., 2013; Mordecai et al., 2013, 2017) will be crossed much more frequently, potentially driving increases in the incidence of vector-borne diseases (Laporta et al., 2015; Messina et al., 2019)."

Climate change projections point to major increases in several heat INDICES across the region for all scenarios (high confidence). Largest increases in the frequency of hot days (maximum temperatures, Tx > 35°C) are projected for the Amazon basin under SSP5‑8.5 with more than 200 days per year at the end of the century under SSP5‑8.5 relative to 1995- 2014, while such increases remain moderate (50–100 days) in SSP1‑2.6. For the dangerous heat threshold of HI > 41°C, increases in frequency are similar to that in Tx > 35°C (Figure 12.4 and Figures 12.SM.1 and 12.SM.2; Coppola et al., 2021b; Schwingshackl et al., 2021)."

AR6_WG1_12_74,12,50,"Landslide: Several regions in Central America, as well as Colombia and south-eastern Brazil, are considered areas of high incidence of observed fatal landslides. In these areas, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-driven fluctuations in rainfall amounts (Sepúlveda and Petley, 2015) and climate change (Nehren et al., 2019) seem to be key factors. Rockfalls, ice- and rock-ice avalanches, lahars and landslides have been reported frequently in the southern, extratropical Andes in the last decades (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016). A large number of ice- and moraine-dammed lakes have consequently failed, causing floods that rank amongst the largest events ever recorded (Iribarren Anacona et al., 2015). However, published literature is largely missing for a reliable assessment of past and future trends of such hazards. Aridity: Several regional studies suggest increasing trends in the frequency and length of droughts in the region, such as: over NWS (Domínguez-Castro et al., 2018), NSA (Marengo and Espinoza, 2016; Cunha et al., 2019) and NES (Marengo and Bernasconi, 2015), over southern Amazonia (Fu et al., 2013; Boisier et al., 2015), in the São Francisco River basin and the capital city Distrito Federal in Brazil (Borges et al., 2018; Bezerra et al., 2019), in the southern Andes (Vera and Díaz, 2015), in central southern Chile (Boisier et al., 2018), in SES (Rivera and Penalba, 2014) and, during recent years, in SSA (Rivera and Penalba, 2014).

End-of-century RCP8.5 projections show a longer dry season in the central part of South America and decreased precipitation over the Amazon and central Brazil (Teichmann et al., 2013; Coppola et al., 2014a; Giorgi et al., 2014; Llopart et al., 2014; Atlas.7). Seasonal changes are also projected by end century under RCP 8.5, with decreases in June–July–August (JJA) rainfall projected for NSA, the coastal region of SES, SAM and the southern portion of SWS (Marengo et al., 2016). Decreases in December –January–February (DJF) rainfall are projected for the central part of South America in the near term (Kitoh et al., 2011; Chou et al., 2014; Cabré et al., 2016). Regional projections for Central and South America also INDICate an increase in dryness in SCA and NES by mid- to end-century (medium confidence) (Chou et al., 2014; Marengo and Bernasconi, 2015). Hydrological drought: Chapter 11 assessed mostly low confidence in observed changes in hydrological droughts given a lack of studies and clear evidence, with medium confidence only for a streamflow decrease in sub-regions of SWS (Table 11.15). Some trends are becoming more clear, such as the ones reported for Colombia (NWS) by Carmona and Poveda (2014), who INDICated that 62% of the 25- to 50-year-long monthly average streamflow time series exhibited significant decreasing trends. However, studies of discharge changes INDICate that uncertainty is still large, as argued by Pabón-Caicedo et al. (2020) for the full extent of the Andes. A number of studies project decreases in runoff and river discharge for SCA, Colombia, Brazil and the southern part of South America by the end of this century (Nakaegawa and Vergara, 2010; Arnell and Gosling, 2013; van Vliet et al., 2013). Section 11.9 assessed high confidence in projections of increases in hydrological droughts in NSA, SAM, SWS, and SSA under for 4°C GWL, medium confidence in SCA, and low confidence in the rest of the sub-regions given insufficient evidence, lack of signal or mixed signals among the available studies. Signals are much more uncertain for the middle of the century (or for a 2°C GWL)."
AR6_WG1_12_76,12,51,"Fire weather: There is evidence of increases in forest fire activity (number of fires, burned area and fire duration) in central and south- central Chile, where more conducive fire weather conditions have been proposed as the main driver (González et al., 2018; Urrutia- Jalabert et al., 2018).

Sun et al., 2019). This is consistent with the large increase in the frequency of joint occurrence of extreme hot and dry days projected for a 2°C warming level or more (Vogel et al., 2020). Projections of fire weather INDICES also show an increased risk in SWS (high confidence), SSA and SCA (medium confidence). However, wildfires highly depend on land use and appropriate management may help mitigate future increases in fire risk (Fonseca et al., 2019). Mean precipitation is projected to change in a dipole pattern with increases in NWS and SES and decreases in NES and SWS (high confidence) with further decreases in NSA and SCA (medium confidence). There is medium confidence of an increase in river floods in SAM and SES. There is high confidence of an increase in drought duration in NES, an in the number of dry days and drought frequency in NSA and SAM. Dry climatic impact-drivers are projected to increase at the regional level with higher global warming levels.

A reduction in snow cover of about 15% was simulated for areas with altitudes in the range of 3000–5000 m, whereas in regions with altitude below 1000 m (Patagonia) snow cover extent increased. The reduced snowfall over the Chilean and Argentinean Andes mountains, which has resulted in unprecedented reductions in river flow, reservoir volumes and groundwater levels, led to the most severe and long-lasting hydrological drought (2010–2015) reported in the adjacent semi-arid foothills of the central Andes (Garreaud et al., 2017; Rivera et al., 2017; Masiokas et al., 2020).

Zhang et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2021; see Section 2.3.1.4.4). Re-analyses also show declining winds in Europe (Deng et al., 2021) with large interdecadal variability (Laurila et al., 2021). The declining trend has induced a corresponding decline in wind power potential INDICES across Europe (low confidence) (Tian et al., 2019). However, there is low agreement and limited evidence that climate model historical trends are consistent with observed trends (Tian et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2021). Several factors have been attributed to these trends, including forest growth, urbanization, local changes in wind measurement exposure and aerosols (Bichet et al., 2012), as well as natural variability (Zeng et al., 2019). Due to changes in mean surface wind speed patterns (C. Li et al., 2018) and the poleward shift of the North Atlantic jet stream exit, mean surface wind speeds are projected to decrease in the Mediterranean areas under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 by the middle of the century and beyond, or for GWLs of 2°C and higher (high confidence), with a subsequent decrease in wind power potential (medium confidence) (Hueging et al., 2013; Tobin et al., 2015, 2018; Davy et al., 2018; Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Kjellström et al., 2018; Moemken et al., 2018; Figure 12.4). However, sub-regional patterns of change are shown in regional climate models, such as an increase in wind speeds in the Aegean Sea and in the northern Adriatic Sea, where a reduction of Bora events and an increase of Scirocco events are projected for mid-century and beyond under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (medium confidence) (Tobin et al., 2016; Davy et al., 2018; Belušić Vozila et al., 2019). Projections (as cited above) also INDICate a decrease in mean wind speed in Northern Europe (medium confidence, medium agreement) (Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Tobin et al., 2018; Jung and Schindler, 2019). Daily and interannual wind variability is projected to increase under RCP8.5 only in Northern Europe (low confidence) (Moemken et al., 2018), which can influence electrical grid management and wind energy production (low confidence). Wind speeds are projected to shift towards more frequent occurrences below thresholds inhibiting wind power production (Weber et al., 2018). Wind stagnation events may become more frequent in future climate scenarios in some areas of Europe in the second half of the 21st century (Horton et al., 2014; Vautard et al., 2018), with potential consequences on air quality (low confidence).

Extreme near-surface winds have been decreasing in the past decades (Smits et al., 2005; Tian et al., 2019; Vautard et al., 2019) according to near-surface observations. Significant negative trends of cyclone frequency in spring and positive trends in summer have been found in the Mediterranean basin for the period 1979–2008 (Lionello et al., 2016).

Central Europe is one of the regions where glaciers are projected to lose substantial mass even under low-emissions scenarios (Section 9.5.1.3; MedECC, 2020).

AR6_WG1_12_114,12,72,"Landslide: Heavy rainfall, such as from tropical cyclones, can trigger landslides over steep terrain in the small islands (Bessette-Kirton et al., 2019). There is limited evidence to determine long-term trends in rainfall-induced landslides in the small islands (Kirschbaum et al., 2015; Sepúlveda and Petley, 2015; Froude and Petley, 2018; Bessette- Kirton et al., 2019). There is low confidence in future changes in landslides in the small islands. The direction of change may depend on future changes in precipitation, tropical cyclones, climate modes (e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation, ENSO), as well as human disturbance, but more data and understanding of the complexity of these relationships are needed, especially in these vulnerable areas (Sepúlveda and Petley, 2015; Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; Froude and Petley, 2018). Aridity: Current estimates identify many small islands as being under water stress and thus particularly sensitive to variations in rainfall and groundwater, population growth and demand, and land-use change, among others (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2; Holding et al., 2016). From 1950 to 2016, a heterogeneous but prevalent drying trend is found in CAR (low confidence), where drought variability is modulated by the tropical Pacific and North Atlantic oceans (Table 11.15 and Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Table 1; Herrera and Ault, 2017). In the future, increased aridity and decreased freshwater availability are projected in many small islands due to higher evapotranspiration in a warmer climate that partially offsets increases or exacerbates reductions in precipitation (Karnauskas et al., 2016, 2018b; Hoegh- Guldberg et al., 2018). Increased aridity is projected for the majority of the small islands, such as in CAR, southern Pacific and western Indian Ocean, by 2041–2059 relative to 1981–1999 under RCP8.5 or at 1.5°C and 2°C GWLs, which will further intensify by 2081–2099 (medium confidence) (Karnauskas et al., 2016, 2018b). Groundwater recharge is projected to increase in Maui, Hawaii except on the leeward side of the island, which underscores the importance of topography and elevation on freshwater availability in different island microclimates (Brewington et al., 2019; Mair et al., 2019). Hydrological drought: There is low confidence of widespread changes to hydrological drought in CAR or Pacific small islands in recent decades, although an increasing number of studies document local changes. Records in Hawaii INDICate downward trends in low streamflow and base flow from 1913 to 2008 (Bassiouni and Oki, 2013). Decadal variability of Hawaiian streamflow coincides with rainfall fluctuations associated with the Pacific Decadal Variability although significant average declines in surface and baseflow runoff of about 8% and 11% per decade, respectively, have been noted during the 1987–2016 period (Clilverd et al., 2019)."
AR6_WG1_12_115,12,72,"There is low confidence in hydrological drought change projections, given low signal-to-noise ratios and the challenge in representing island scales in global analyses. Prudhomme et al. (2014) recognized CAR as one of the regions with the highest increase in regional deficit INDEX (RDI; a measure of the fraction of area in hydrological drought conditions) by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5. Daily streamflow and extreme low flows in two watersheds in Oahu, Hawaii are projected to decline by mid- and end of the 21st century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, which would result in more frequent hydrological droughts in this area (Leta et al., 2018)."

Records of wildfire in Hawaii from 2005 to 2011 INDICate a peak in area burned during the hot and dry summer months, but Trauernicht et al. (2015) note the difficulty in establishing the link between past climate and wildfire trends due to human activities and vegetation changes. Availability of literature limits assessment on future fire weather in the small islands. Drying and warming trends tend to increase fire probability aside from the climate impact on fuel loading, for example, grassland fires in Hawaii (Trauernicht, 2019), and wildfires in Puerto Rico (Van Beusekom et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_12_117,12,73,"Mean wind speed: Scarcity of observations limits assessment of long-term changes in winds over the small islands in the Pacific and CAR. Records INDICate that average daily wind speeds have slowly declined in Hawaii, but have remained constant across western and southern Pacific sites since the mid-20th century (Marra and Kruk, 2017). Recent studies of reanalyses and hindcast simulations INDICate an intensification of the Pacific trade winds during the 1992–2011 period, which contributed to the ocean cooling in the tropical central and eastern Pacific (England et al., 2014; Takahashi and Watanabe, 2016). Projections estimate up to 0.4 m s –1 (8%) increase in annual winds in CAR under RCP8.5, which is associated with changes in the extension of the North Atlantic Subtropical High that enhances the Caribbean low-level jet during the wet season, and stronger local easterlies due to enhanced land–ocean temperature differences in the dry season (Costoya et al., 2019) (low confidence)."
AR6_WG1_12_118,12,73,"Projections of global changes in tropical cyclones INDICate more frequent Category 4–5 storms (high confidence) and increased rain rates (high confidence) (Knutson et al., 2020), with relative sea level rise exacerbating storm surge potential, but with large regional differences (see Section 11.7.1.5). By the late 21st century, tropical cyclones are projected to be less frequent in the basins of the western and eastern North Pacific, Bay of Bengal, Caribbean Sea and in the Southern Hemisphere, but will be more frequent in the subtropical central Pacific (Murakami et al., 2014; Yoshida et al., 2017; Bell et al., 2019; Knutson et al., 2020). Over CAR, tropical cyclone intensity is expected to increase by the end of the century under RCP8.5 due to higher sea surface temperatures but can be inhibited by increases in vertical wind shear in the region (medium confidence) (Kossin, 2017; Ting et al., 2019). The poleward movement of the area in which tropical cyclones reach peak intensity in the western North Pacific is likely to continue, which affects the tropical cyclone frequency over the small islands in the area (Section 11.7.1.5; Kossin et al., 2016). Projections also INDICate an increase (decrease) in the tropical cyclone frequency during El Niño (La Niña) events in the Pacific at the end of the 21st century (Chand et al., 2017). RCP8.5 2080–2099 projections INDICate a 2% increase in the number of tropical cyclones in the north-central Pacific relative to 1980–1999, with tracks shifting northward towards Hawaii (N. Li et al., 2018). Given projected reductions to the overall number of tropical cyclones but increases in storm intensity, total rainfall and storm surge potential, we assess medium confidence of overall changes to tropical cyclones affecting the Caribbean and Pacific small islands."

AR6_WG1_12_120,12,73,"Coastal flood: Relative sea level rise, storm surges and swells contribute to coastal inundation in the small islands, where studies on historical trends in coastal flooding are currently limited. For example, a swell event due to distant extratropical cyclones in December 2008 raised extreme water levels leading to flooding affecting five Pacific island nations: Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati and Solomon Islands (Hoeke et al., 2013; Merrifield et al., 2014). Over low-lying atoll islands in the north-west tropical Pacific, potential increases in the frequency and areal extent of coastal flooding, especially at higher SLR scenarios, are expected to have negative consequences for freshwater resources and island habitability (Storlazzi et al., 2015, 2018). Select tide gauges across the Pacific also INDICate increasing trends in the frequency of minor flooding since the 1960s (Marra and Kruk, 2017)."
AR6_WG1_12_121,12,75,"Coastal erosion: Recent studies have INDICated variable and dynamic changes in shorelines of reef islands (medium confidence), including both erosion and accretion, which suggest factors other than SLR affecting shoreline changes, such as in the central and western Pacific within the past 50-to-60-year timeframe (Webb and Kench, 2010; Le Cozannet et al., 2014; Ford and Kench, 2015; Duvat and Pillet, 2017). For example, islands on atolls in the central and western Pacific have not substantially eroded or reduced in size in the past decades while sea level has been rising, but their position and morphology have changed due to anthropogenic factors (e.g., seawalls, reclamation) and climate–ocean processes (Biribo and Woodroffe, 2013; McLean and Kench, 2015). Analysis of aerial and satellite imagery revealed severe shoreline retreat in six islands and the disappearance of five vegetated reef islands in Solomon Islands in the western Pacific between 1947 and 2014, which may be due to the interaction between SLR and waves (Albert et al., 2016). In French Polynesia, changes in shoreline and island area have been observed since the 1960s, partly due to the effect of TCs on sediment changes and human activities (Duvat and Pillet, 2017; Duvat et al., 2017). Coastal erosion has also been noted over the small, low-lying, sandy islands, such as in French Polynesia and Solomon Islands, among others (Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018). Average shoreline retreat rates between 1 and 2 m yr –1 are estimated for the islands in the equatorial Pacific and in CAR, while a retreat rate of 0.5 m yr –1 is estimated for islands in the South Pacific, based on satellite observations from 1984–2016 (Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018). There was also a loss of 610 km 2 compared with a gain of 520 km 2 in coastal area in Oceania during the 1984–2015 period (Mentaschi et al., 2018)."
AR6_WG1_12_122,12,75,"Projections INDICate that shoreline retreat will occur over most of the small islands in the Pacific and CAR throughout the 21st century with spatial variability (high confidence). Median shoreline change projections (CMIP5) relative to 2010, presented by Vousdoukas et al.

In CAR islands, sandy shorelines are projected to retreat by about 80 m by mid-century under both RCPs. By 2100, more than 100 m of median shoreline retreat is projected for all small islands under both RCPs; notably in CAR where retreats approaching 200 m (relative to 2010) are projected under both RCPs. The total length of sandy coasts in CAR and Pacific small islands that is projected to retreat by more than a median of 100 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is about 1100 km and 1200 km respectively, an increase of approximately 14%."

There is very high confidence that the Indian Ocean, the western equatorial Pacific Ocean, and western boundary currents have warmed faster than the global average, while the Southern Ocean, the eastern equatorial Pacific, and the North Atlantic Ocean have warmed more slowly or slightly cooled (Section 9.2.1.1). It is virtually certain that global mean SST will continue to increase in the 21st century at a rate depending on future emissions scenario, with CMIP6 projections INDICating an increase of 0.86°C (likely range 0.43°C–1.47°C) under SSP1‑2.6 and 2.89°C (2.01°C–4.07°C) under SSP5‑8.5, by 2081–2100, relative to 1995–2014 (Section 9.2.1.1). Global warming of 2°C above pre-industrial levels is projected to increase SST, resulting in the exceedance of numerous hazard thresholds for pathogens, seagrasses, mangroves, kelp forests, rocky shores, coral reefs and other marine ecosystems (medium confidence) (Poloczanska et al., 2013a, b, 2016; Liu et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014; Graham et al., 2015; Schoepf et al., 2015; Gobler et al., 2017; Henson et al., 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017; Krueger et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018a, b; Perry et al., 2018). It is virtually certain that upper- ocean stratification has increased at a rate of 4.9 ± 1.5% during 1970–2018 and that this will continue to increase in the 21st century (Section 9.2.1.3), potentially leading to reduced nutrient supply and total productivity (low confidence) (Moore et al., 2018). Marine heatwave: Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have increased in frequency over the 20th century, with an approximate doubling since the 1980s (high confidence), and their intensity and duration have also increased (medium confidence) (Box 9.2). Projections show that this increasing trend likely continues with 2–9 times more frequent MHWs (at global scale) projected by 2081–2100, relative to 1995–2014 under SSP1‑2.6, and 4–18 times more frequent MWHs under SSP5‑8.5. The largest changes in MHW frequency are likely to occur in the tropical ocean and the Arctic, while there is medium confidence of moderate increases in the mid-latitudes, and of small increases in the Southern Ocean (Box 9.2). Permanent MHWs (more than 360 days per year, relative to the historical climate conditions) are projected to occur in the 21st century in parts of the tropical ocean, in the Arctic Ocean, and around latitude 45°S, under SSP5‑8.5 (Box 9.2). The occurrence of such permanent MHWs can be largely avoided under the SSP1‑2.6 scenario (Box 9.2). MHWs can have devastating and long-term impacts on ecosystems (Oliver et al., 2018), making them an emerging hazard for marine ecosystems (Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018; Smale et al., 2019). A series of MHWs that occurred in 2010–2011 had consequences for seagrass in western Australia (Wernberg et al., 2013; Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018), and for the lobster fishery in the Gulf of Maine (Pershing et al., 2018). The MHWs that occured western Australia in 2015/2016 led to the third-highest mass coral bleaching globally (Le Nohaïc et al., 2017)."

In the Indian Ocean, sea surface salinity is projected to decrease by between 0.49 and 0.75 psu by 2080, compared to 2015, under RCP2.6 and RCP2.6, respectively (Akhiljith et al., 2019). Projections for the North and South Atlantic oceans INDICate increasing salinity in the upper layer (0–500 m) under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, due to the decreasing freshwater input from the equator and increasing net evaporation (Skliris et al., 2020). There is medium confidence that fresh ocean regions (Pacific, Southern and Indian oceans) will get fresher and salty ocean regions (Atlantic Ocean) will get saltier over the 21st century (Section 9.2.2.2; IPCC, 2019b).

In recent decades, low-oxygen zones in ocean ecosystems have expanded, and projections INDICate an acceleration with global warming (medium confidence) (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Gilly et al., 2013; Gobler et al., 2014). A 2% loss (4.8 ± 2.1 pmoles O ) in total dissolved oxygen in the upper ocean layer (100–600 m) has been observed during 1970–2010 (Section 2.3.4.2), with the highest oxygen loss of up to 30 mol m –2 per decade in the equatorial and North Pacific, the Southern Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean (Section 5.3.3.2).

Higher Arctic precipitable water totals are also connected with observed increases in heavy precipitation and convective activity (high confidence) (Ye et al., 2015; Kharin et al., 2018; Chernokulsky et al., 2019).

Landslide and snow avalanche: There is a growing number of studies on mass movements in polar regions. Although there is low confidence in widespread observational trends for landslides or snow avalanches, a rise in the number of future landslides is supported by strong links to increases in heavy precipitation, glacier retreat, and thawing of ice-rich permafrost that can lead to retrogressive thaw slumps in Arctic regions (Section 2.3.2.5; Kokelj et al., 2015; Derksen et al., 2018; Lewkowicz and Way, 2019; Patton et al., 2019; Ward Jones et al., 2019)."

Over the period 1961–2013, the annual area of drylands in drought has increased, on average by slightly more than 1% per year, with large interannual variability (Olsson et al., 2019). In general, droughts have increased in several arid and semi-arid areas over the last decades (medium confidence), and are likely to increase in the future as INDICated by a number of INDICES calculated from climate (Liu et al., 2018b; Zkhiri et al., 2019; Coppola et al., 2021b; Driouech et al., 2021; see also Figure 12.4j–l)."

Model projections of future changes in dust are hindered by the uncertainties in future regional wind and precipitation as the climate warms (Evan et al., 2016); in the effect of CO fertilization on source extent (Huang et al., 2017); and in the impact of human activities upon the land surface (Ginoux et al., 2012; see Chapter 10). Projected trends in dust storms and dust loads in deserts and semi-arid areas vary from region to region. Dust loadings are expected to decrease over most of the Sahara and Sahel (low confidence) (Section 12.4.1), increase over Mexico and the south-west USA (medium confidence) (Section 12.4.6), and there is low confidence of a future trend due to climate change in other continents (Sections 12.4.2–12.4.5)."

The AR5 and SR1.5 INDICated several specific climatic impact-driver changes that are particularly important to tropical forests: mean temperature increase, long-term drying trends (including shifts in the length of the dry season), prolonged drought, wildfires and surface CO increase for inland forests (IPCC, 2013, 2018). The SRCCL assessed an enhanced risk and severity of wildfires in tropical rainforests (high confidence), but fires are not only a natural process but are also affected by deforestation and other human influences (IPCC, 2019a)."

Observations and reanalyses over the past three to four decades, combined into fire risk INDICES, show that the fire weather season length has been increasing by about 20% globally (Jolly et al., 2015), and this INDEX exhibits particularly high trend values over tropical forest areas of South and Central America and Africa. There is generally low confidence in future projections of general fire weather risk evolution in tropical forests and evolutions depend on the region (Abatzoglou et al., 2019). Over the Amazon basin the fire risk increase is projected to emerge well before 2050 while for other equatorial forests no significant evolution is found. In Savanna areas the risk increase is found to be more general."

AR6_WG1_12_145,12,85,"(almost half) under SSP1‑2.6. Several global-scale studies have shown that high temperature extremes will increase everywhere (high confidence) (Gourdji et al., 2013; Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson, 2017; Harrington et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2018; Lehner et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2018; Tebaldi and Wehner, 2018; Arnell et al., 2019; Russo et al., 2019; Schwingshackl et al., 2021), although the change depends on the INDICATOR (see also Chapter 11). For example, by 2080, at least 80% of the land surface is expected to experience average summer temperatures greater than the historical (1920–2014) maximum with high (RCP8.5) emissions (Lehner et al., 2018). The areas of rice and maize cropland with damaging extreme temperatures during the reproductive season will increase by a factor of three under RCP8.5 (Gourdji et al., 2013). Under a high emissions scenario, heatwaves that are currently considered rare are projected to become the norm almost everywhere by the end of the century (Russo et al., 2014). Heat stress as a combined function of temperature and humidity also increases at the global scale, especially with high emissions (e.g., Matthews et al., 2017). Growing degree-days and cooling degree-days also increase everywhere (Arnell et al., 2019) with the absolute and proportional changes depending on temperature threshold. Increases in temperatures will result in reductions in heating degree days (Arnell et al., 2019; Coppola et al., 2021b) and a widespread reduced frequency of cold extremes (high confidence)."
AR6_WG1_12_146,12,85,"Integrating the results of the regional assessments in Section 12.4 shows that changes in CIDs linked with the water cycle or atmospheric dynamics (e.g., storms) vary more among regions, largely due to the spatial pattern of changes in atmospheric circulation and changes in precipitation and evaporation (Chapters 8 and 11). There is high confidence that heavy precipitation and pluvial floods will be increasing in a majority of land regions, primarily due to the well-understood Clausius–Clapeyron relationship describing the increase in moisture content with air temperature (Chapters 8 and 11), but there is a large spatial variability in fluvial flood hazards. Top-down global- scale studies show that although fluvial flood hazards are projected to decrease in regions where there are large reductions in seasonal rainfall totals or where warmer temperatures mean less accumulated snow, at the global scale, fluvial flood hazard (characterized as the area affected, size of peak or likelihood of an event) is projected to increase substantially through the century (Giuntoli et al., 2015; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Winsemius et al., 2016; Alfieri et al., 2017; Dottori et al., 2018; Arnell et al., 2019). Projected changes in agricultural and hydrological drought characteristics are dependent on the INDICATOR used to define drought (Sections 11.6 and Section 12.3.2), but there is at least medium confidence of an increase in the drought hazard in many parts of the world. This is also reflected in global-scale studies, with Naumann et al. (2018), for example, showing that the global mean average drought duration (based on the SPEI INDEX which is calculated from the difference between precipitation and potential evaporation) increased from 7 months with the current climate to 18.5 months for a global warming level of 3°C. The apparent global increase in drought occurrence is greater when evaporation is captured in the drought INDICATOR (e.g., SPEI) than when the INDICATOR is based on precipitation alone (as in SPI; Carrão et al., 2018). There is evidence that the likelihood of simultaneous events in several locations will increase: Trnka et al. (2019) found that the proportion of wheat-growing areas"
AR6_WG1_12_147,12,86,"The regional assessment in Section 12.4 shows that fire weather is projected to increase with medium or high confidence in every continent of the world, including Arctic polar regions. Globally, fire weather is projected to increase in future, primarily due to higher temperatures and exacerbated where precipitation reduces. By 2050, 60% of the global land area would see a significant increase in fire weather under RCP8.5 (Abatzoglou et al., 2019). There is less confidence in the projected distribution of change in fire weather across regions in global-scale studies. For example, Moritz et al., (2012) projected an increase in fire weather in mid- and high latitudes but a reduction in the tropics, whilst Yu et al. (2019) and Bedia et al. (2015) projected an increase in the tropics. These differences reflect differences in methodologies and fire weather INDICES adopted in different studies."
AR6_WG1_12_148,12,87,"There is high confidence that most of the world’s sandy coasts will experience shoreline retreat, in the absence of terrestrial or offshore sediment sources. Median projections presented by (Vousdoukas et al., 2020b) INDICate that 13.6% (36,097 km) and 15.2% (40,511 km) of the world’s sandy beaches could retreat by more than 100 m by 2050 (relative to 2010) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively, implying a 12% increase in severely threatened shoreline length under RCP8.5, relative to RCP4.5. These median projections increase to 35.7%–49.5% (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively; or 95,061 km–131,745 km) by the end of the century, implying a 38% increase in severely threatened shoreline length under RCP8.5, relative to RCP4.5."
AR6_WG1_12_149,12,87,"The emergence of a climate change signal occurs when that signal exceeds some critical threshold (usually taken to be a measure of natural variability; see for example, Hawkins and Sutton, 2012) or when the probability distribution of an INDICATOR becomes significantly different to that over a reference period (e.g., Chadwick et al., 2019; see also Chapter 10 and Section 1.4.2), in which case external anthropogenic forcings can be detected as causal factors. The ‘time of emergence’ (ToE) or ‘temperature of emergence’ is the time or global warming level thresholds associated with this exceedance. Emergence is particularly relevant to impacts, risk assessment and adaptation because human and natural systems are largely adapted to natural variability but may be vulnerable if exposed to changes that go beyond this variability range; this is not to say that changes within natural variability have no impact, as occurrence of damaging extremes proves. Emergence also informs the timing of adaptation measures. The emergence of a change is always relative to a reference period (e.g., the pre-industrial period or a recent past), depending on the framing question. In the former case, the goal is to estimate the amplitude of an anthropogenically driven change while in the latter, it is to estimate the amplitude of change relative to a baseline that is familiar to stakeholders. Both questions are important for risk assessment, but the former may be more directly interpretable in a mitigation context. The variability also refers to a time scale, generally interannual to inter-decadal. See Section 1.4.2 and Chapter 10 for more details about how emergence is defined and used in the literature."

This section assesses the evidence for the effects of anthropogenic climate change on the emergence of changes in CID INDEX, past, present and future, as evidenced by the literature assessed in other chapters, as well as additional literature assessed here, at both global and regional scales. In many cases, however, sufficient literature for a robust region-by-region assessment of ToE is lacking. The assessment herein is made by CID. Regional emergence assessment is reported in Tables 12.3–12.11 but is undertaken in this section."
AR6_WG1_12_151,12,88,"Mean air temperature: Warming of mean annual temperatures has already emerged in all land regions, as obtained from past observations and confirmed by historical simulations (high confidence) (Figure 1.13; King et al., 2015; Hawkins et al., 2020), with S/N ratios larger than two. In the current climate, the highest S/N ratios exceed five over Central Africa, Amazonia, East and South East Asia. Seasonal warming emergence depends on the season. Because the temperature variability in the mid-latitudes is higher in winter than in summer, the emergence of seasonal warming occurs for summer but not for winter in most of this part of the world. In Europe, summer warming has emerged in all regions (medium confidence, medium agreement), and in North America, it has emerged only over Eastern and Western regions while in winter there is low confidence of an emergence in warming in all regions for both Europe and North America (Lehner et al., 2017; Hawkins et al., 2020). When considering the climate of the end of the 20th century (i.e., recent past) as a baseline, the emergence of mean temperature is projected at very different times depending on the scenario. For instance, emergence is reached by 2050 under RCP8.5 in most areas of Europe, Australia or East Asia, but it does not occur within the 21st century under RCP2.6 (medium confidence) (Sui et al., 2014; Im et al., 2021). This means that under RCP2.6, mean temperatures stay within the recent climate variability range observed in the mid-latitudes. However, even under RCP2.6, mean temperatures in tropical regions that have not already emerged are projected to emerge before 2050 (medium confidence). Extreme heat and cold: An increase in heat extremes has emerged or will emerge in the coming three decades in most land regions (high confidence) (Chapter 11; King et al., 2015; Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020), relative to the pre-industrial period, as found by testing significance of differences in distributions of yearly temperature maxima in simulated 20-year periods. In tropical regions, wherever observed changes can be established with statistical significance, and in most mid-latitude regions, there is high confidence that hot and cold extremes have emerged in the historical period, but only medium confidence elsewhere. In other regions emergence is projected at the latest in the first half of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (high confidence) (King et al., 2015; Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). Relative to the end of 20th-century conditions, changes in humid heat stress as characterized by wet bulb temperature, INDICates a ToE as early as in the first two decades of the 21st century in RCP8.5 at least in many tropical regions (most of Africa in the band 20°S–20°N, South Asia and South East Asia) (medium confidence) (Im et al., 2021). By 2050 and under RCP8.5, wet bulb temperature is projected to emerge in many other areas such as Southern Africa, North Africa, Europe, and most of Central, Southern and Eastern Asia and Northern and Eastern Australia, while under RCP2.6, emergence is either reached later in the century (Europe, Central Asia, Northern Australia), or never reached in the century (Im et al., 2021). Decrease of cold spells has already emerged above the interannual variability in Australasia, Africa and most of Northern South America, and they are projected to emerge before 2050 in the northern mid-latitudes and in Southern South America (King et al., 2015) under RCP8.5 (medium confidence, limited evidence and high agreement)."
