The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) is a unique international legal instrument and intergovernmental platform which aims to ensure the sustainable use of transboundary water resources by facilitating cooperation. Initially negotiated as a regional instrument, it has been opened up for accession to all UN Member States in 2016.

The Protocol on Water and Health, jointly serviced by UNECE and WHO-Europe, is a unique legally binding instrument aiming to protect human health by better water management and by reducing water-related diseases. The Protocol provides a practical framework to translate into practice the human rights to water and sanitation and to implement SDG 6.

Programme of Work
The main tool to support implementation of the Water Convention is its Programme of Work, which is adopted every three years by the Meeting of the Parties. The programme of work is shaped to address political and technical challenges of Parties and non-Parties in managing their transboundary water resources.
More specifically, the Programme of Work supports policy processes and technical cooperation from the national, to the basin and global levels  and focuses on various topics such as adaptation to climate change, the water-food-energy-ecosystem nexus approach or the sustainable financing of transboundary water cooperation.
The Programme of Work â€˜s implementation is guided and reviewed by the Working Group on Integrated Water Resources Management, the Working Group on Monitoring and Assessment, the other technical bodies under the Convention, and, at the highest level, the Meeting of the Parties to the Convention.
